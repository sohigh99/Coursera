<h1><a name="_Toc485803891"></a>Project Outline</h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803892"></a>Company Profile</h2>
<p>Samyang, a sugar manufacturer in Korea, has more than 70 years of history with over 5,000 employees worldwide. The business parties comprise,</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple oversea suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil</li>
<li>Two manufacturing plants in Korea</li>
<li>4 Sales offices/companies and warehouses in Seoul, Shanghai, New York, and London</li>
<li>And numerous customers for the sugar as producer goods or finished goods globally</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, other traditional manufacturing companies, to minimize the inventory and to maximize the customer satisfaction, this business requires the streamlined business interfaces through,</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning (Oracle&rsquo;s Fusion using Hyperion):&nbsp; network within database servers generated through daily transactions</li>
<li>Supply Chain Management (SCM, Oracle&rsquo;s Fusion): external communication with suppliers based on the usage of raw materials including transportation</li>
<li>Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne) as a backbone system: communication between the servers and end-users using various interfaces (HyperText Markup Language (HTML) client on the desktop, mobile client, and Business Service with external business parties)</li>
<li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM, Siebel Business Application): communication with customers through the Internet</li>
<li>Oracle e-Commerce for the internet transaction: all Internet transactions (Oracle, 2017).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this upgrade proposal encompasses the server virtualization, the distributed network upgrade is in due course.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803893"></a>Summary of benefit using Distributed Network</h2>
<p>A computer network is an essential technology for a distributed system for the business applications, the home applications, and the mobile users (Tanenbaum &amp; Wetherall, 2010). In other words, the distributed systems are constructed on top of a computer network. Hence, the integration of multiple Enterprise Solutions is more or less same with the distributed process which can be successful on the distributed network.</p>
<p>Commonly, the aspect of distributed architecture comprises the expandability (multi-site, multiple system types, multi-channel), scalability (both network &amp; site capacity), and reliability (multiple levels of redundancy) and resilience (Roy &amp; Emmett, 2011).&nbsp; These distributed computing systems comprise computers, networks, and operating systems and application software. Though the networks are components in distributed environments, the same aspect repeats for the benefit of distributed networking. So the network is able to provide for the future network topology (flexibility), is capable of scaling and expanding (growth, scalability), and is to respond automatically to failures and sustain network traffic (high-availability, reliability) (D-Link, 2007).</p>

<hr width="80%">

<h1><a name="_Toc485803894"></a>Distributed Network Requirements Analysis</h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803895"></a>Functionality (Capacity, and Performance Requirement)</h2>
<p>This upgrade encompasses hardware upgrade, enterprise solutions upgrade, and migrating to the virtual environment to meet the industry requirement which changes rapidly. Here we review the usage of each Enterprise Solutions, capacity, and performance requirement.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803896"></a>Planning (via Hyperion).</h3>
<p>This system collects all data in the various database system to analyze it in the virtualized environment. This application makes use of high performance in I/O though the number of users to access this application is less than 10.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803897"></a>SCM (Supply Chain Management).</h3>
<p>This layer requires the communication between Samyang and the chain of suppliers. Samyang post the plan and forecast which resulted in the supply and demand. Two main requirements for this application is scalability and security rather than the speed of network by putting the requirement planning data into the area where all members in SCM can access.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803898"></a>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).</h3>
<p>This layer supports multiple communication with multiple logic and application servers. The HTML client requests a certain computation through Java Application Server (JAS), then JAS through a Logic server which accesses the database server to manipulate it. This layer enables the communication between multiple supplier's systems through Business Service (BSSV) and allows the mobile interface through the smartphones using Application Integration Services (AIS) server. Almost all the employees scattered globe are to access this application to hold the daily transactions. Hence, availability and security are the main requirements for this enterprise application.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803899"></a>CRM (Customer Relationship Management).</h3>
<p>Internal application layer to maintain and support all sales matters within the organization. This layer integrates with the ERP solution directly with limited access using higher security through the application layer.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803900"></a>Oracle&rsquo;s e-Commerce.</h3>
<p>The customer accesses the end goods to purchase through the Internet. And this system interfaces with the ERP system. The layer requires higher availability, security, and speed through load distribution, flexible routing, WebSocket connection. For higher performance, Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) offloading, content caching, and HTTP compression can be used (Oracle, 2017).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803901"></a>Connectivity and Security Requirements</h2>
<p>Samyang can consider implementing software-based networking (SDN) to minimize the overhead in maintaining multiple servers.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is worthy of study on Network functions virtualization (NFV). According to the vendor, it has benefits like rapid development of software in comparison to protocol standardization and development, simplification of network maintenance due to centralized control, and ability to swiftly deploy, relocate and upgrade new features (Gittik, 2014).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803902"></a>Planning (via Hyperion).</h3>
<p>The availability and speed are the main concern for this solution. So for a network topology, a typical active-passive failover mode which requests via HTTP/S to connect the virtual IP which accesses the pool of database servers (Oracle, 2017). To have the maximum I/O performance Samyang can consider Sun Storage 16 Gb Fibre Channel PCIe Universal Host Bus Adapter (HBA), QLogic for its hardware.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803903"></a>SCM (Supply Chain Management).</h3>
<p>Possibly, DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ) can be considered using a four-port Ethernet card in the firewall (Tech-FAQ, 2016). And to tackle possible vulnerability, suggesting Software Defined Networking (SDN) which has some tangible benefits like, more granular security, lower operating costs, and guaranteed content delivery (Ingrammicro, n.d.).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803904"></a>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).</h3>
<p>The ERP system is the backbone system for Samyang which holds daily transactions, so higher availability and security are the focal point for this software. Currently, ERP software Oracle&rsquo;s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne is the Internet Application in distributed system which has link among HTML or Mobile client, JAS (Java Application Server), Logic Server, and Database Server which are all virtually connected with each other and communicate using socket call. Both (V)LAN ((Virtual) Local Network Network) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) are current way to communicate with each other, which is secured network. Desired protocol will be TCP/IP.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803905"></a>CRM (Customer Relationship Management).</h3>
<p>The users for CRM overlaps with the user of ERP system when both systems are integrated well. So one of concern here is network traffic to the user using the Internet. Another consideration is to maintain higher availability, the distributed data center, and replication can be reviewed. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803906"></a>Oracle&rsquo;s e-Commerce.</h3>
<p>This enterprise solution is open to the public, so Samyang has to focus on the network security. Possibly this system needs implementing some of security technology hashing for data integrity, encryption for privacy, firewalls, intrusion detection system for data integrity (Comer, 2015). Other network security methods for this system can be a reverse proxy (traceability), Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)-enabled HTTP and TCP listener, Web Application Firewall (by defining the security rule), and HTTP Forward Proxy Support in Origin-Server Pools (Oracle, 2017).</p>

<hr width="80%">

<h1><a name="_Toc485803907"></a>Communication Protocols Analysis and Recommendations</h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803908"></a>Analysis &ndash; What is happening?</h2>
<p>The hype around cloud ERP is everywhere. Many IT professional claims that on-premise is dead. So far, Samyang was able to post daily transactions through on-premise ERP Oracle&rsquo;s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne with lots of doubt on whether this solution gives them the best return on investment. In the modern computer world, it is hard for a single package to provide the user with full solutions varying unique practice. The integration of different software is arguably must-do-now.</p>
<p>The parties who claim on-premise is dead suggesting that through the cloud, you can transform your IT organization, you can focus on the core competencies, you can pay less, you can change your organization, and you can have world-class security (Kimberling &amp; Bolon, 2017). Without a doubt, this due course of an upgrade for Samyang is timely.</p>
<p>As suggested in Unit 1, the success of the upgrade in the area of enterprise solutions, the operating systems, and the computer network for Samyang is highly dependent on how to configure each machine to communicate faster and more reliable because each enterprise solutions has a different audience which requires the different nature of the network.</p>
<p>The network protocols serve the functionalities to address data to the right recipient, physically to transmit data from source to destination with security protection, to receive the message and respond an acknowledgment (Mitchell, 2017). In the age of the Internet which is a form of statistical multiplexing, commonly the most of the protocol make use of the packet switching because which allows many-to-many communication (Comer, 2015). So next section will discuss further on the protocol suggestions for each communication channels.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc485803909"></a>To-Be Recommendation &ndash; where to go?</h2>
<p>As discussed earlier, the upgrade project covers the integration of different enterprise solutions, the planning, SCM, ERP, CRM, and e-Commerce which have different audience and communication requirement. Here we review the protocol recommendation through Table 2-1 where most of the protocols will be an open standard.</p>
<p>At the high level, the management of the computer networks is to be Software-Defined Networking (SDN) because this technology enables any system to connect any other system, Storage Area Network (SAN), or Local Area Network (LAN) at any site (Oracle, 2017). Regardless actual choice made by Samyang between the virtualized servers and the bare metal servers, the Fabric Virtualization can be used as a medium between servers and LAN/SAN.</p>
<p>According to IDC, the Fabric Virtualization/Interconnect uses a centralized device, often named an I/O director/gateway, which covers the physical I/O adapter (e.g., Ethernet or Fibre Channel) for multiple servers (Chen, 2013). Oracle claims that the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-enabled, 100 Gb network is used for this technology (Oracle, 2017).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>Note</em>: In a real system, a single enterprise solution can have multiple protocols because the same application requires multiple servers. For instance, when running ERP software, the HTML client talks to the JAS, JAS to the Logic Server, and the Logic Server to the Database Server. So depending on the functionality or requirement, the protocol can be assigned. So this table is to demonstrate different protocol per OSI Reference Model, or TCP/IP Reference Model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, there can be many different protocols per layer whether we follow Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model or TCP/IP Reference Model. Some are available for certain hardware or the operating systems others are tied to the specific the networking hardware or platform. &nbsp;Nonetheless, the goal of the distributed network is aiming at flexibility, scalability, reliability, and high-availability on top of quicker and safer network. In reviewing some industry trend, for some engineered system, the software and hardware conjunctions is connected to a virtualized, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-enabled, with 100 Gb network. And Software-defined networking (SDN) services allow any system to connect to other systems, SANs, or LANs at any site to have a fast, agile, and secure infrastructure (Oracle, 2017).</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc485803910"></a>Network Traffic Analysis and Recommendations</h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803911"></a>Network Traffic Analysis per Usage</h2>
<p>The usage of network for Samyang can be categorized followings: Data Mining for planning solution, HTML clients for the ERP solution, and the Internet usage for Customer Relationship and Supply Chain Management. Having different topology for these solutions, here we review current requirement and future extension by analyzing current requirement properly. Regardless the server virtualization, the communication channel for these solutions are important not to disrupt the daily business. As the business grows, the enterprise opts to provide its customer and supplier with bigger software and more data in addition to the natural growth of suppliers and customers. In turn, this can cause the network congestion as a due course. Hence, the proper network usage analysis is one goal to have sustainable enterprise for any organization with effective investment which includes both infrastructure and software.</p>
<p>Commonly computer networks comprise the network interface or Network Interface Card (NIC), hubs, switches, routers, media (cabling), and software. In this section, we may review some of this infrastructure and software to brief the algorithm in it not to have congestion or better performance.&nbsp; Based on both hardware and software configuration made, the network engineer is to perform the physical layer testing, reachability and connectivity, packet analysis, network discovery, device interrogation, event monitoring, performance monitoring, flow analysis, routing and traffic engineering,&nbsp; configuration, security enforcement, network planning (Comer, 2015).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803912"></a>Data Mining for planning solution.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: &nbsp;Within an organization, this configuration is highly dependent on the infrastructure to handle data fetching from multiple database servers.</li>
<li>The traffic estimates: Likewise any big data analysis, the main concern here is the size of data rather than the number of requests. Each server is real-time production data, the request for data are to be compromised with other enterprise solutions. Hence, the peak traffic time follows other applications run.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Considerations: Samyang is looking for superior I/O connectivity where the servers are virtualized. So this storage networking requires faster and cost-efficient solution. Since this solution is read only routine, other solutions can impact this. For the best storage networking, Samyang may implement the host bus adapter (for instance, 16 Gb Fibre Channel (FC) PCIe Universal Host Bus (HBA), and switches and directors for Storage Area Network (SAN) to meet the requirement.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc485803913"></a>HTML client for ERP.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Purpose:&nbsp; Throughput and latency are key factors for this system. All named users who interact with servers through HTML client. 5,000 users globally which can be over 2,000 concurrent users. The simplified communication structure is users run both interactive application and batch application. Interactive applications talk to JAS for the presentation, and the JAS is talking to Logic Server where all the C business functions are running, which in turn for I/O, communicate with the database server. Whereas the batch applications are always running in the logic server.</li>
<li>The traffic estimates: During month-end closing, the highest network traffic is expected. Possibly this layer is sitting on top of VLAN to have proper communication in the server virtualization.</li>

<em>Software-Defined Network. </em>
Allows for more agile networks by abstracting the static architecture of conventional networks into a software-controlled layer (Oracle, 2017). Some literature represents it as Software-Managed Networks (SMN) because this concept is not simply meaning the virtualization of software hardware (Kassner, 2014). Hence, the purpose of SDN is to supply open interfaces which enable the development of software to control the connectivity supplied by a set of network resources and the flow of network traffic through them (Bailey, et al., 2014).

<li>A centralized approach (transparent to the system &amp; easy to deploy).</li>

<li>Since the application is network-aware, so the correlation of congestion issues can be done automatically (Bakalov, 2015).</li>
<li>Centralized control of multi-vendor environments, reduce complexity, a higher rate of innovation, increase reliability and security, more granular network control, better user experience, and so forth (Open Networking Foundation, 2012).</li>

<p>&nbsp;<em>Note</em>: All methodology above is more related with software than the physical networking infrastructure. As multiple kinds of literature indicate, these can have the best performance with proper hardware configuration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In summary, the growing usage of the network is faster than the development of the network hardware and software. So it is crucial to measure and implement some of emerging technology to have the best outcome per limited investment.</p>

<p>Above diagram is very high-level generic configurations and putting in the main communication channel. As a result, the Internet access from the end-users is not described here. The cloud here is assumed either the hosted services or bare metal configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803918"></a>Software-Defined Network (SDN)</h2>
<p>As discussed earlier, the whole purpose of this proposal is not to compromise the security vulnerability with proper network congestion control. A typical configuration for SDN is adding layer in between infrastructure layer and application layer to have better control on traffic. Figure 4.1 shows basic architecture of SDN.</p>

<p>The benefit of above configuration is that it is programmable directly, agile, centrally managed, programmatically configured (Opennetworking, 2017).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803919"></a>Infrastructure and Software Requirements</h2>
<p>For the successful &nbsp;migration from a traditional server-client system to the virtual environments, Samyang is to consider below factors,</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical network: to configure VLANs, Routing, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Data Center Bridging. This comprises the management and the virtualization for logical network configuration, the logical network for gateway and the software load balancer, and the storage for the logical network.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Physical host machines: to enable hypervisor (e.g., Hyper-V) to run.</li>
<li>Routing infrastructure: to create a BGP peer on the router that is used by your SDN infrastructure to receive routes.</li>
<li>And Default gateways: to connect to multiple networks (McIllece et al., 2017).</li>

<p>The engineered systems are pre-integrated to reduce the cost and complexity of IT infrastructures while increasing productivity and performance (Oracle, 2017). At a glance, each engineered systems cost from USD 50,000 through 1.2 Million for a single machine for <em>Oracle Database Appliance</em> through <em>Oracle Exadata Database</em> Machine in case Samyang has to own its machine. And this configuration incurs high maintenance cost without saying. Whereas moving the enterprise to the virtualization or clouds, the most of the cost factors diminishes because Samyang is making use of existing network infrastructure where the network software is supplied by the hosting company.

<p>Forbes introduced some emerging technology which can impact the computers and its network. Some examples are the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others argue the real big thing is a big data as well as machine learning. Whatever the future is all these technologies affects the computer network in the distributed organization. So it is worthwhile to watch out what is coming.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803924"></a>Future Network Consideration for Samyang</h2>
<p>In any computing environment, it is hard to decouple software from hardware. And the computer networking is no exception. The biggest transition is the change of ownership in many areas of various industry for the network infrastructure as well as software. Since the purpose of business remains same that is measured through the Return On Investment (ROI). So here we review possible network architecture for Samyang to get ready to adopt new technology.</p>
<p>To survive in the stiffer competition in the sugar market environment, Samyang has to implement seamless communications across the business channel as we have discussed earlier where communication takes places both vertical and horizontal level. Some of the possible options are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the entire Enterprise Solutions (Planning, ERP, SCM, CRM, and e-Commerce) to the Cloud. These applications have to be mission-critical based on the Service Level Agreement (SLA ) with the vendor (e.g., Oracle).</li>
<li>Implement both public clouds and private clouds to have controlling power on some data and applications. Connect these clouds using the technology of the cloud networking.</li>
<li>Make use of SD-WAN to connect multiple branches across the globe, or select vendor that support this configuration. This configuration has to be based on SD-WAN Orchestration using network virtualization software.</li>
<li>Implement Software-defined network (SDN) for data centers to have better congestion control and better security among databases server which hold the business data.</li>
<li>Make full use of the network analytics tools to monitor and make a decision dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc485803925"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>The transformation from the server-client model to the clouds model change the most aspects of a computing environment including the computer network. Nevertheless, it is high time for Samyang to review the current configuration and be ready to embrace the open opportunities to adopt new technologies.</p>
