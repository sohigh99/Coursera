<h2><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
<h3><a name="1.1"></a>Understanding Standard Receipts</h3>
<h4><a name="1.1.1"></a>Overview</h4>

<p>Manual receipts can be used to register cash received into the Accounts Receivable system quickly, if a receipt is urgent and cannot wait for the next automatic receipts cycle for example.</p><p>Receipts are entered in batches, just as  invoices are entered in batches.  The system assigns the batch type RB to all records that are generated by the manual receipts applications. When you apply a receipt to invoices, the system creates one document to represent the receipt, which is stored in the Receipts Header table (F03B13), and one document for each invoice to which you apply the receipt, which is stored in the Receipts Detail table (F03B14). As with other Accounts Receivable processes in EnterpriseOne, receipt entry consists of three main stages: Enter, Review, and Post.</p><p></p>

<h4><a name="1.1.2"></a>Understanding Receipt Entry Methods</h4>
<p>Depending on the type of receipt, you can use either the Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102) or Speed Receipts Entry (P03B0001) program to enter receipts. Unapplied or general ledger receipts can be entered using either program. To help determine which method is used, consider the advantages and limitations of standard and speed receipts entry:</p>

<h4><a name="1.1.3"></a>Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102)</h4>
<p>When using standard receipts entry you can:</p><ul><li>Use either the Load or Select feature to display open items for a customer.</li><li>Enter information directly from a customer&rsquo;s remittance slip.</li><li>Apply receipts to invoices that include discounts or write-offs.</li><li>Create chargebacks for discount amounts or short payments.</li><li>Create deductions for short payments.</li><li>Create stand-alone chargebacks, write-offs, and deductions.</li><li>Apply unapplied amounts to invoices.</li><li>Apply receipts that are logged through Speed Receipts Entry.</li><li>View the results of receipts entry.</li><li>Locate and revise receipts.</li><li>Delete unposted receipts and receipt pay items.</li><li>Void posted receipts and receipt pay items.</li><li>Designate receipts as insufficient funds (NSF).</li><li>Apply receipts in an alternate currency.</li></ul><p>When using standard receipts entry you cannot:</p><ul><li>Enter receipts as quickly as you can using Speed Receipts Entry because you use multiple forms to access open items and enter receipt information.</li><li>Enter logged receipts.</li><li>Apply receipts using a balance-forward method.</li></ul>

<h4><a name="1.1.4"></a>Speed Receipts Entry (P03B0001)</h4>
<p>When using speed receipts entry you can:</p><ul><li>Use one form to enter multiple receipts.</li><li>Enter logged receipts.</li><li>Enter balance-forward receipts.</li><li>Create automatic write-offs.</li></ul><p>When using speed receipts entry you cannot:</p><ul><li>Create chargebacks, manual write-offs, or deductions.</li><li>Pre-load open items.</li><li>Use this program as a stand-alone system.</li><li>Locate or revise receipts.</li><li>Delete or void receipts.</li><li>Designate receipts as NSF.</li><li>View the results of receipts applications</li></ul>

<h4><a name="1.1.5"></a>Receipt Document Types</h4>
<p>The main document types generated by the receipt applications are:  </p><table style="width: 100%;" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tbody><tr><th class="km" style="width: 20%;">Document Type</th><th class="km" style="width: 20%;">Description</th><th class="km" style="width: 60%;">Use</th></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RC</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Receipt</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type when a receipt is entered.</td></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RO</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Void Receipt</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type when a receipt is voided.</td></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RS</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Spread Receipt</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type when a credit memo is applied to an invoice on a zero amount receipt. This document type is not assigned when applying an unapplied receipt to an invoice.</td></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RV</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Insufficient Funds Receipt</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type when a customer has insufficient funds in the bank to pay the payment.</td></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RU</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Unapplied Receipt</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type to a receipt that is not applied to a specific invoice.</td></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RL</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Logged Receipt</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type to a receipt that is not associated with a customer or payor.</td></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">RR</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Rounding Record</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;">The system assigns this document type when a foreign currency receipt is either fully applied on the foreign side, but not fully applied, or fully unapplied on the foreign side but not fully unassigned on the domestic side on the domestic side due to rounding issues. This rounding record is at the receipt level and is not associated with any particular invoice pay item.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div class="kmnotebox">Note - Document types (RU. R5, RS, etc) generated by the AR receipt entry P03B102 are hard coded in the program and it cannot be changed.  </div><p></p>


<h2><a name="2"></a>Standard/Manual Receipts </h2>
<h3><a name="2.1"></a>Overview</h3>
<!-- <h4><a name="2.1.1"></a>Overview</h4> -->
<p>Using Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102), you can select invoices paid by the receipt and determine how to handle short payments or unearned discounts to the invoices that are specified on the receipt. This is the most common method of applying receipts and provides the most flexibility for receipt application.</p><p>Type input (TI) codes are used to specify how  the system will  apply payment amounts. Based on the payment amount entered and the  type input code used, the system can calculate write-off, chargeback, and deduction amounts, as well as determine whether discounts that are available are earned. Invoices can also be overpaid  to generate a credit to the customer&rsquo;s account.</p><div class="kmnotebox">Note - Once the receipt is saved it is not possible to change the receipt number.</div>
   
<h4><a name="2.1.2"></a>Type Input (IT) Codes</h4>
<p>When receipts are applied to invoices, a type input (TI) code is used to automatically calculate amounts to apply for payments, discounts, write-offs, chargebacks, and deductions.</p><p>This table lists the types of input codes for standard receipts entry  and how they can be  used to automatically calculate any necessary amounts. The same TI codes can also be used for Draft Entry in Enter Our Drafts/Enter Customer Drafts (P03B602).</p><p></p><table style="width: 100%;" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tbody><tr><th class="km" style="width: 20%;">Type Input Code</th><th class="km" style="width: 20%;">Description</th><th class="km" style="width: 60%;">Use</th></tr><tr><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">10</td><td class="km" style="width: 20%;">Simple Invoice Match</td><td class="km" style="width: 60%;"><ul><li>Payment amount = current open amount minus discount available</li><li>  Discount taken = discount available</li><li>Write-off = optional</li><li>Chargeback = optional</li><li>Deduction = optional</li></ul><p align="left">This code simply applies the receipt amount against the selected invoice(s) and includes any available discount.

A deduction is created for the outstanding amount, after taking into account any available discounts. The deduction can then be researched and processed at a later time.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>A receipt can be entered using a single type input code or multiple codes if for example discount is required on one invoice, a deduction on another, a write off on a further invoice. Each invoice can be addressed individually by using the type input codes in any combination.</p><p></p>

<h3><a name="2.3"></a>Basic Steps to Enter a Standard Manual Receipt (P03B102)</h3>
<p class="km">1. To enter a standard manual receipt, go to Standard Receipts Entry - Work with Customer Receipts Inquiry (P03B102/W03B102A) and click 'add'</p><p class="km">2. The Standard Receipts Entry - Receipt Entry (P03B102/W03B102E) screen will open. Enter the required header information information - company, payor, receipt amount and currency at a minimum. If GL Date, Receipt Date, and Customer Number are not filled in, they will default to today's date and from the payor field respectively. If the Bank Account field is not completed, this will default from the RB  Automatic Accounting Instructions (AAI)  set up.</p><p><img src="../images/rec01.png" alt="" width="597" /></p><p>
<p>3. There are several methods to insert open invoices into the receipt. To select a specific invoice or set of invoices that the receipt is paying, take the Form exit 'Select'. Click 'Find' to load the grid with the available invoices for that customer and company. Select the required invoice in the grid and click 'Select'. This will enter a check mark against the required invoice. Repeat as required if several invoices are to be paid.</p>
<p><img src="../images/rec02.png" alt="" width="597" /></p><p>

<p>4. Then click 'Close' to return to the Receipt Entry screen and insert the selected invoice(s) into the grid. If a default TI code has been selected in the Standard Receipt Entry (P03B102) processing options, this will default into the grid. Otherwise. manually enter the TI code and check the amounts that are calculated.</p>

<h4><a name="3.1.2"></a>Automatic Accounting Instruction (AAI) set up for Unapplied Cash Receipts</h4>
<p align="left">The RC Automatic Accounting Instruction (AAI) acts as a holding or clearing account until invoices are paid. This AAI specifies the offset account used during the invoice and receipt post processes. These entries have Document Type AE.   When setting up the RC AAI, the business unit is optional.   The G/L offset (UC) is used for unapplied cash. If the RCUC AAI is not set up, the system will not use RC_____ as the default. Set up this AAI for Company 00000. This AAI may also be set up as company-specific.   The RC and RCUC AAIs reflect the trade balance. The only difference between these AAIs is the offset, therefore, these AAIs may be set up for the same account or a different accounts to track the unapplied balances separately from realized A/R trade.   Below are two scenarios for setting up the RC and RCUC AAIs. The first example shows the entries that are created when the RC and RCUC AAIs point to two different accounts. The second example identifies the entries that are created when the two AAIs point to the same account.</p><ul><li>Example 1 - Different Accounts.

<h2><a name="4"></a>Stand-Alone Receipts</h2>
<h3><a name="4.1"></a>Enter Stand-Alone Receipt</h3>
<h4><a name="4.1.1"></a>Entering Stand-Alone Records in Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102)</h4>

<p align="left">Stand-alone records are write-offs, chargebacks, and deductions that are not associated with any known invoice. These can be created  when the customer sends a payment for several invoices, but the payment amount does not equal the total amount of the invoices. The stand-alone feature can also be used when an unapplied payment is applied to several invoices and a small difference between the totals exists. In these scenarios, the system matches the payment to invoices, but the shortage is recorded without specifying a particular invoice. You can also use the stand-alone feature without performing an invoice match. For example, you can create a deduction or write off a small duplicate payment. Additionally, to distribute an unapplied payment to several customer accounts, you can enter a stand-alone chargeback without invoice matching. When you use the stand-alone feature without invoice matching, you must enter the amount as a credit (negative); otherwise the  system creates an unapplied payment for twice the amount specified.  It is recommended that you use the stand-alone feature in conjunction with invoice match, whenever possible.</p><p align="left"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><p align="left"><em>For stand-alone write-offs</em>:</p><ul><li>Ensure that you set the maximum amount in the Manual Write-Off processing option high enough so that the system accepts entry.</li><li>Verify that the account that you want to use for the each write-off reason code is set up for the AAI item RA xx, where xx is the write-off reason code.</li><li>Verify that the processing option on the Edits tab is set up to allow write-offs.</li><li>Verify that the values that you want to use for the write-off reason code are set up in UDC 03B/RC.</li></ul><p align="left"><em>For stand-alone chargebacks:</em></p><ul><li>Verify that the chargeback A/R trade account is set up for the AAI item RC xxxx, where xxxx is the  chargeback general ledger offset code.</li><li>Verify that the processing options on the Chargeback tab are set up.  </li><li>Verify that the values that you want to use for the chargeback reason code are set up in User Defined Code (UDC) 03B/CB.</li></ul><p align="left"><em>For stand-alone deductions</em>:</p><ul><li>Verify that the deduction suspense account is set up for the AAI item RN.</li><li>Verify that the values that you want to use for the deduction reason code are set up in UDC 03B/CR.</li></ul>

<h2><a name="5"></a>Apply Credit Memos Against Invoices</h2>
<h3><a name="5.1"></a>Enter Credit Memo and Invoices In Receipts</h3>
<a name="aref_section13"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Applying Credit Memos Against Invoices</strong></h3><p align="left">When the customer has outstanding credit memos, they can be applied  to outstanding invoices using the Standard Receipts Entry program (P03B102). As often there is no  physical payment, you can enter zero in the Receipt Amount if offsetting a credit memo directly against an invoice for the same amounts. You can use the Load, Select, or Remittance feature to display the credit memo and invoice, and then you use the appropriate type input code to apply the credit memo to the invoice. If the credit memo does not fully pay the invoice, you can leave the invoice open for the amount that remains, or create a write-off, chargeback,or deduction record for the difference.</p><p align="left">When you fully apply a credit memo to an invoice, the system:</p><ul><li>Closes the RM credit memo document in the Customer Ledger (F03B11) table by updating the pay status to 'P'.</li><li>Closes the RI invoice document in the Customer Ledger (F03B11) table by updating the pay status to 'P', if the invoice is fully paid.</li><li>Creates a record in the Receipts Header (F03B13) table for a zero amount.</li><li>Creates RS receipt documents in the Receipts Detail (F03B14) table for both the credit memo and the invoice.  </li></ul><p>After you apply credit memos to invoices, you must post the batch to update the general ledger.</p><p>Two processing options for Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102) affect how credit memos are displayed in the grid and applied to invoices. The processing options are 'Type Input Code' and 'Apply Invoices' on the<em> Process</em> tab. If the Type Input Code processing option is blank, the Apply Invoices processing option is ignored.   The Apply Invoices processing option specifies how to apply receipt amounts to invoices that are loaded into the grid detail in the Receipt Entry form. Valid values for this processing option are:</p><ul><li>Blank - Apply invoices up to the receipt amount (i.e. apply full amount of each transaction in the grid detail until the receipt amount is reached)</li><li>1 - Apply all invoices (i.e. apply the full amount of each transaction in the grid detail)</li></ul><p>If the Apply Invoices option is blank, the system automatically applies invoices up to the receipt amount; remaining invoices are not considered. If the Apply Invoices option is blank and both credit memos and invoices are selected in the grid detail, the credit memos must be selected into the grid before the invoices for the system to recognize the credit memos. In other words, the credit memos must be at the top of the grid detail since the transactions are considered in order from top to bottom within the grid when applying amounts. <br /><br /> If the Apply Invoices option is populated with a "1," the system applies the receipt to all transaction open amounts. The system considers all invoices and credit memos loaded into the grid detail area. The credit memos do not need to appear at the top of the grid. <br /><br /><strong>Examples</strong></p><ul><li>Processing option for Type Input Code = 10 (Simple Invoice Match)</li><li>Processing option for Apply Invoices = Blank (apply up to the receipt amount)</li><li>Receipt amount = 100.00</li><li>Invoice amount = 200.00, due date = 6/15/11</li><li>Credit memo amount = 100.00, due date = 6/30/11</li></ul><p><br /><em>Apply Invoices = Blank</em><br /><br /> When open invoices for the customer are selected using the Load option, the system loads the invoice into the grid detail area before the credit memo because the invoice has an earlier due date. Using the Select option can also result in the invoice being selected before the credit memo. When the invoice  precedes the credit memo in the grid, the system automatically applies the receipt amount of the 100.00 to the invoice, leaving an open amount for 100.00 on the invoice. The system does not consider the credit memo because the full amount of the receipt is applied to the first invoice. <br /><br /><em>Apply Invoices = 1</em><br /><br /> If the Apply Invoices processing option is populated with a '1' (apply all invoices), the system pays the entire amount of the invoice (200.00) and continues to the next transaction to pay the credit memo (-100.00). The system considers all transactions in the grid detail area, even if the amount applied to a single invoice exceeds the amount of the receipt. Because the total amount applied is equal to the amount of the receipt, the system processes the transaction without error.  </p>

For example, you need to record a credit card refund to a customer that is greater than the credit card payment.</p><p>Negative receipts can be entered via Standard Receipts entry (P03B102) by setting a processing option (Processing option # 4 on the <em>Process</em> tab) to enable the entry of negative receipts.</p><p>You can enter a negative receipt for the refund amount and offset it against a credit memo so that the general ledger accurately reflects the credit to the bank account and the debit to the A/R trade account. When you enter a negative receipt, the system generates a Receipt Detail record (F03B14) and updates the pay status of the credit memo to <em>P</em>  to prevent it from being refunded again.  </p><p>You can also enter negative receipts when you need to:</p><ul><li>Make a negative adjustment directly to the general ledger, such as a cash transfer.</li><li>Enter an outgoing wire transfer.</li><li>Record an NSF receipt as a general ledger receipt.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: Credit Card Refund</strong></p><p>A customer purchases goods or services from you with a credit card. An invoice is created for 90.00 for the purchased items. The credit card company deposits funds directly into the bank account for the customer&rsquo;s purchase. Meanwhile, a refund in the amount of 150.00 is issued by the credit card company for returned items previously paid for by the customer. The refund amount is greater than the credit card payment (90.00) from the customer, which results in a negative amount of 60.00. To offset the negative amount, you need to create a receipt for -60.00 and apply it to a credit memo for the refund and to the invoice for which the customer paid.</p><p>The credit card company directly deposits and withdraws funds from the bank account.</p><p><strong>Steps to complete:</strong></p><ol><li>Create an invoice (RI) for the customer  for the amount of 90.00.</li><li>Post the invoice to create these G/L entries:</li><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Debit of 90.00 to A/R trade.</li><li>Credit of 90.00 to store sales.</li></ul><li>Create a credit memo (RM) for the refund amount of 150.00.</li><li>Post the credit memo to create these G/L entries:</li><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Credit of 150.00 to A/R trade.</li><li>Debit of 150.00 to store sales.</li><li>The A/R trade account reflects a credit amount of 60.00.</li></ul><li>Using Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102), create a negative receipt in the amount of 60.00 and apply it against the credit memo (RM) for 150.00.</li><li>Apply the remaining 90.00 to the customer&rsquo;s invoice (RI). When you complete the receipt, the system closes the credit memo and the open A/R invoice in the Customer Ledger (F03B11) table.</li><li>Post the receipt to create these G/L entries:</li><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Debit of 60.00 to the A/R trade. This entry offsets the negative amount created by the credit memo.</li><li>Credit of 60.00 to the bank account.</li></ul></ol><p><strong>Example: Negative G/L Adjustment</strong></p><p>You process a customer&rsquo;s payment through a credit card company. The credit card company charges you a 3.5 percent fee to process the transaction. When you receive payment from the credit card company, you want to enter the processing fee directly to the general ledger and apply the full amount that the customer paid to the associated invoices.</p><p>For example, a customer paid the credit card company 9,647.05 for these invoices:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>RI 3125 for 1,162.75</li><li>RI 3126 for 5,034.30</li><li>RI 3127 for 3,000</li></ul><p>In addition to fully applying the customer&rsquo;s payment to the three invoices, you need to create a negative G/L receipt for the 3.5 percent credit card processing fee of 337.65. As a result, the system closes the invoices and creates an entry to the corresponding expense account in the general ledger.</p><p><strong>Steps to complete:</strong></p><ol><li>Using Standard Receipts Entry (P03B102), enter the receipt information specifying 9,309.40 as the receipt amount.</li><li>Select the three invoices to be paid and apply the invoice amount as the payment amount to each invoice. A negative amount of 337.65 remains as unapplied.</li><li>Select General Ledger from the Form menu.</li><li>Specify the account to which you want to make the adjustment for the processing fee.</li><li>Enter the negative amount of 337.65.</li><li>Complete the entry. The system applies the full amount that the customer paid to the credit card company closing out the three invoices.</li><li>Post the receipt to create these G/L entries:</li><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Debit of 337.65 to an expense account for the credit card processing fee.</li><li>Debit of 9,309.40 to a bank account.</li><li>Credit of 9,647.05 to the A/R trade account reducing the customer&rsquo;s liability.</li></ul></ol><p></p>

This helps  distinguish insufficient funds receipts from reversals for entry errors for reporting and analytical purposes. If the receipt is not posted at the time that it is designated as insufficient funds, the system also marks the posted status of this record as  'D' (posted).</li><li>Restores the open amount of the invoice or group of invoices to which the receipt applied.</li><li>Changes the pay status of the invoices from paid 'P' to approved 'A'.</li><li>Creates a new record in the Batch Header  table (F0011), if the receipt is posted.    </li><li>Creates a new record in the  Receipts Detail (F03B14) table with a matching document type RV, if the receipt is posted.  If the receipt is not posted when it is designated as insufficient funds, the system deletes the original  record in the F03B14 table.  The new batch must  be posted to update the general ledger accounts with reversing information. When posting a receipt that is designated as insufficient funds, the system creates in the Account Ledger (F0911) table a record with  the document type 'RV'.</li></ul><p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> - To include the bank&rsquo;s address and transit account, set up the necessary information in the Address Book system (Work with Addresses P01012)   and on the Set Up G/L Bank Account form (P0030G).</p><p><strong>Designating Receipts as NSF</strong></p><p>Access the Work with Customer Receipts Inquiry form (P03B102/W03B102A).</p><p>To designate receipts as NSF:</p><ol><li>On Work with Customer Receipts Inquiry (P03B102/W03B102A), select the receipt that needs to be  designated as NSF.</li><li>From the Row menu, select 'NSF'.</li><li>On Confirm Delete, click 'OK'.</li><li>On Void/NSF Receipt, complete the G/L Date and Reason Code fields and click 'OK'.</li></ol><p><strong>Reversing an NSF</strong></p><p>Once a receipt has become an NSF, it cannot be reversed because it works similar to void. Just as once a void is done, it cannot be reversed. The system creates an additional line in Receipts Detail (F03B14) with Document Type = "RV" for the NSF with a new batch number.    Thus, once the NSF designation is created through the NSF/Void Receipt form, it has essentially voided the receipt beyond further change.   If an NSF needs to be 'reversed' the only option at this point would be to post the NSF to the G/L, create a new receipt, and apply the new receipt to the original invoice.</p><p></p>
