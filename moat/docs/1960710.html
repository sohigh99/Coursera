<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding Debit Statements Within Automatic Payment Processing in Accounts Payable (P04574).</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2><p>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Debit Statement Questions (R04574)</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:&nbsp;</strong> Why does a negative payment group not require an Update?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong>&nbsp; If a payment group has a negative total, the automatic payment process only creates a Debit Statement (R04574). No update is performed on this type of transaction because no records are written to the Accounts Payable Matching Document (F0413) or Accounts Payable Matching Document Detail (F0414) tables for Debit Statements.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Why is the check number getting updated when a Debit statement is printed?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:&nbsp;</strong> Previously, the bank account's next payment number was improperly incremented when debit statements were printed. Debit statements and unused alignment forms were included in the calculation of the bank account's next payment number. The application has been corrected to no longer include debit statements in the check stub total used to update the bank account's next payment number. The next payment number is also no longer incremented for unused alignment forms when only debit statements are printed.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong>&nbsp; What is the name of the print file generated for debit statements?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong>&nbsp; A debit statement is used to notify suppliers of an overpayment. The pdf file generated by the debit statements&nbsp;is R04574.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:&nbsp;</strong> Is it possible to reprint debit statements?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:&nbsp; </strong>Yes, if the PDF output file has been saved. &nbsp;Debit statements are created during payment processing. When a payment group containing debit amounts for a supplier is written, debit statements are generated. The debit statements are contained in a pdf file. From the Submitted Job Search, you can locate the debit statement output and reprint the debit statements. &nbsp;If the PDF output was not saved, you can only reprint debit statements by recreating them via the Automatic Payment process.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:&nbsp;</strong> How can debit memos be netted to the open vouchers for a supplier?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> If a supplier has a voucher and debit memo with offsetting amounts (e.g. 100 and -100), it is possible to net the voucher and the debit memo. There are two ways to acheive this:<br /><br />A. Use Payment with Voucher Match (P0413M): <br />Make sure the processing options behind P0413M are set to allow negative amount payments. Then enter the zero amount payment as you would a normal payment.<br /><br />B. Use Automated Payments.<br />In the processing options for Create Payment Groups (R04570), on the tab labeled 'Amounts', review the value in the processing option for Minimum Payment Amount. The minimum payment amount is the minimum total payment for the supplier. Make sure this option is set to blank to allow the creation of a debit statement. The steps are as follows:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a version of Create Payment Groups (R04570) with a blank or a zero in the processing option for Minimum Amount on the 'Amount' tab. (The minimum payment amount is the minimum total payment for the supplier.)</li>
<li>Run this version for the voucher and its reversing voucher.</li>
<li>In Work With Payment Groups (P04571) write the payment group, so that a Debit Statement (R04574) is generated.</li>
<li>Then update the payment group, this will close the voucher and its reversing voucher.</li>
</ol><hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong>&nbsp; Is it possible to prevent debit memos from netting against vouchers?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6</strong>:&nbsp; Yes. A demo version of Create Payment Groups, R04570, is provided which includes preset data selection to include only vouchers where the open amount is greater than zero. Create a copy of the XJDE0002 version, Create Payment Groups - No Debits,&nbsp;for use in payment processing. Alternately the data selection of a current version of R04570 can be revised to include "And BC Amount - Gross (F0411) is greater than zero" This option excludes from payment processing those vouchers and/or debit memos where the open amount is less than zero.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:&nbsp;</strong> How can zero amount or zero dollar checks be created?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 7:&nbsp;</strong> Zero amount, zero dollar, checks are not produced. If the total vouchers and debit memos for a supplier included in the payment process equals zero, a Debit Statement is created.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:&nbsp;</strong> Why are debit memos&nbsp;not netting against open vouchers?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8:&nbsp;</strong> Review the following potential causes that result in debit memos not netting against open vouchers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify each voucher and debit memo for the supplier contains the same information indicated in the data selection of the submitted version of Create Payment Groups. For example, if the data selection specifies company information, the short account ID for the bank account, and posted code values verify both the debit memos and vouchers contain the same key information.</li>
<li>Verify each voucher and debit memo for the supplier contains the same information indicated in the processing options of the submitted version of Create Payment Groups. Verify each transaction falls within the processing option pay through date.</li>
<li>Verify the&nbsp;fields defined by the Sequence Review (UBE version specified in the Processing Option for Create Payment Groups) do not have different values&nbsp;in either the voucher or debit memo such as&nbsp;check handling code or company.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Verify the voucher and the debit memo indicate the same address book number in the alternate payee field. Payments are created for the address book number indicated in the alternate payee field. This value does not always match the supplier number indicated on the voucher or debit memo.</li>
<li>Review the Multiple Payments field on the Supplier Master record. The radio button for 'No' should be indicated.</li>
<li>Verify the data selection for the Create Payment Groups (R04570) version does not include the data selection of "And BC Amount Gross (F0411) is greater then zero.</li>
<li>Verify if&nbsp;the voucher and negative voucher have the same alternate payee, but different suppliers? If so, the Processing Option in Create Payment Groups to create one payment per payee regardless of supplier should be activated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:&nbsp;</strong> How are prepayment vouchers distinguished from debit memos?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 9:</strong>&nbsp; When a prepayment voucher is created, the Miscellaneous Code - A/R and A/P (RPRP1) field on the Accounts Payable Detail Ledger record, F0411, is populated with a value of 1. The Prepayment Selection program (P0411P) uses the value in field RPRP1 to determine how to process each prepayment record.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:&nbsp;</strong> How can I prevent processing debit statements?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10:&nbsp;</strong> Set the processing option for the minimum amount in Create Payment Groups to zero. This option includes payments with a net amount of zero or any positive amount. This option does not prevent negative and positive vouchers from netting against each other for a zero or greater payment amounts. It prevents any negative payment amounts (debit statements) from being included in the Payment Control Group (PCG). &nbsp;If using a multi currency environment, processing option 2 needs to be populated with a currency code.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong>&nbsp; If a minimum amount of zero is entered in the processing option of Create Payment Groups (R04570), does the system prevent credit vouchers from netting against debit vouchers?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11:&nbsp;</strong> If the netting of positive and negative vouchers is exactly zero, the netting occurs and a debit statement is produced. If the netting results in a positive balance, a check is produced. If the netting results in a negative balance, the netting does not take place because the balance for the supplier is less than the minimum amount of zero defined by the processing option. The Create Payment Groups report prints the vouchers for the vendor with the message "Amount Under Payment Limit".</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12:&nbsp;</strong> How can I remove open vouchers and open debit memos from my supplier ledger?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12:</strong>&nbsp; Creating a manual payment for $0 and posting it clears the ledger.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13:</strong>&nbsp; Why is a debit statement created for a payment with a total negative amount but the associated vouchers are left open?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 13:</strong>&nbsp; Automatic Payment processing does not close out vouchers associated to a negative payment. It only creates a debit statement. &nbsp;The resolution is to use Manual Payment With Voucher Match (P0413M) after flagging the processing option to allow negative payments to close these records out.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 14:</strong> Why is the check number in Work with Bank Accounts (P0030G) not picked up when processing zero dollar payments?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 14:</strong> When automatic payment processing is used for zero dollar payments, a debit statement is automatically generated. Therefore, the system assigns a debit statement number from Next Numbers by System (P0002) as the payment number instead of check number from the Bank Account (P0030G). It also clears the open amounts of all records and changes the pay status to paid.</p>
