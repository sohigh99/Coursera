<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p> Use this document to locate and resolve common errors returned by the Account Receivable system regarding Automatic Accounting Instructions used in this system.  The key to removing these errors is correct setup of the AAI Items and the accounts assoicated to them.</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="TRBLSHOOT"></A>Troubleshooting Steps</H2>
<p class="km"><span style="font-size: medium;">Overview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span>Each time you enter a transaction for which the system creates journal entries, the system needs to locate the appropriate account numbers. It does this by reviewing the AAI table for codes that correspond to the transaction. For example, AAIs direct the system to the accounts receivable trade account to debit when you post invoices or the correct bank account to debit when you post receipts.  Use this document to locate and troubleshoot common errors returned when entering invoices or receipts, or posting associated batches in Accounts Receivable.  For complete information on the setup required for all Accounts Receivable AAIs, link to <a href='../docs/1982411.html'>Overview and Set Up of Accounts Receivable Automatic Accounting Instructions (P0012).</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>AAI Errors</strong></span></p>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Errors when AAIs are Missing or Incorrectly Setup in the Automatic Accounting Instruction table (F0012)</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km">Error 023T:  AAI missing for a specific GL Offset</h4>
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km">Error 2976: AAI for G/L Class Code Invalid</h4>
<p class="km">The system validates for AAI setup upon transaction entry as well as at the beginning of the post process (R09801).  The G/L offset(s) used on the transaction(s) are reviewed and the system verifies that AAIs are setup to post the entries needed to balance.  Therefore, this error can be returned when entering invoices or receipts, and can also appear in the work center when posting where a GL Offset is specified on the transactions in the batch.   When the GL offset contains a specific value, such as XYZ, each AAI has a hierarchical sequence by which the system searches for an account number.  For example, when searching for the AR Trade account to post to:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The system searches for AAI item RCXYZ for company XXXXX to locate the A/R trade account.</li>
<li>If the system cannot locate this AAI item, the system searches for item RCXYZ for company 00000.</li>
<li>If the system cannot locate this AAI item, the system returns an error message that the AAI missing for a specific GL Offset. It will not search for RC for Co 00000.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the type of transaction returning the error, different AAIs must be verified.  Review the following AAIs for proper setup of AAI Item + G/L Offset (XXXX) according to the search hierarchy described above:</p>
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h5 class="km">Default AAIs (invoices and receipts) setup with specific GL Offsets:</h5>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong><em>RCXXXX Default AR Trade Account</em></strong> - A/R Trade (holding) account. Contains Document Type AE transactions created by the GL Post (R09801). Set up RCXXXX default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company. Business Unit is optional.</li>
<li><strong><em>RBXXXX  Default Bank Account</em></strong> - The bank account is based on the company number entered on the receipt. Set up for default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company. Whatever offset are set up for the RCxxxx AAI must also be set up for RBxxxx. For example if RCTRAD is set up, RBTRAD must also be set up. Business Unit is required. </li>
<li><strong><em>RTXXXX A/R Taxes</em></strong> - Tax account for taxes when the invoice is posted to GL. For transactions with a specific G/L offset,  the system uses  RTXXXX (where XXXX = value in G/L Offset field of the Customer Master record (F03012) and entered in the Tax Rate/Area set up) is used depending on which Tax Explanation Code is used.   Set up RTXXXX for default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company using a different account. VAT tax uses RTXXXX. Tax Explanation Code 'B' (combination of VAT and Use tax) uses both RT and RTXXXX. For this code, in the Tax Rate/Area setup, the first line is used for VAT, which requires a G/L Offset, and the second line is the Use tax, which ignores the G/L Offset field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km">Error 023Q:  AAI Missing</h4>
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km">Error 031T:  AAI Account Not Setup</h4>
<p>The system validates for AAI setup upon transaction entry as well as at the beginning of the post process.  The system returns this error when an AAI is not setup in Automatic Accounting Instructions.  Therefore, this error can be returned when entering invoices or receipts, and can appear in the work center when posting invoices or receipts.   Review the following AAIs, depending on the type of transaction and verify your setup is correct:</p>
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h5 class="km">Default AAIs</h5>
<p>The following AAIs are edited for during Accounts Receivable transaction entry and processing, including the post process:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>RC Default Trade Account</strong></em><br /> A/R Trade (holding) account. Contains Document Type AE transactions created by the GL Post (R09801).

<li><em><strong>RB Default Bank Account</strong></em><br /> The bank account is based on the company number entered on the receipt. Set up for default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company. Whatever offset is set up for the RCxxxx AAI must also be set up for RBxxxx. For example if RCTRAD is set up, RBTRAD must also be set up. Business Unit is required. </li>
<li><strong><em>RKD Discount Taken/Lost</em></strong><br /> Expense account for discounts taken and created when a receipt is posted. Set up for default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company using a different account. Business Unit is optional. </li>
<li><em><strong>RT A/R Taxes</strong></em><br /> Tax account for taxes when the invoice is posted to GL. Either RT or RTyyyy (where yyyy = value in G/L Offset field of the Customer Master record (F03012) and entered in the Tax Rate/Area set up) is used depending on which Tax Explanation Code is used.   Set up for default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company using a different account. Use Tax uses RT. VAT tax uses RTyyyy. Tax Explanation Code 'B' (combination of VAT and Use tax) uses both RT and RTyyyy. For this code, in the Tax Rate/Area setup, the first line is used for VAT, which requires a G/L Offset, and the second line is the Use tax, which ignores the G/L Offset field.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h5 class="km">Receipts Specific AAIs</h5>
<p>The following AAIs can also be edited for during receipts processing and posting, specifically, depending on the receipts process being performed:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>RCUC Unapplied Cash Receipt</strong></em><br /> Automatic offset account for unapplied receipts not specific to an invoice. Set up for default Company 00000 if all companies share the same account, otherwise set up for each company using a different account. If RCUC is not set up, RCxxxx is not used as the default, where xxxx is the G/L Offset. Instead an error will be issued. Business Unit is optional.

<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km">Error 1309:  AAI Account Set Up Error on Multi-Currency Transactions</h4>
<p>The system returns this error in a multi-currency environment when the account associated to an AAI is not setup correctly.  If the account is a monetary account, the account currency code must be the same as the transaction currency code. The currency code of the account's company must be equal to the base currency for the transaction.  To resolve this error, either change the AAI to use a different account, or revise the currency codes involved in the transaction. This error will be returned for either or all of the companies involved if any of the multicurrency AAIs have a blank in their business unit fields. The multicurrency AAIs are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>RCyyyy or RCxxx: Default Trade Account</li>
<li>RByyyy or RBxxx: Default Bank Account</li>
<li>RKDxx: Discount Taken</li>
<li>RG and RL: Multi-currency Gain/Loss</li>
<li>RV and RW: Multi currency Unrealized Gain/Loss</li>
<li>RRyyy: Unrealized Gain/Loss Offset Account</li>
<li>RY and RZ: Alternate Currency Receipt Gain/Loss</li>
<li>R8: A/R Rounding Account</li>
<li>R7: Alternate Currency Receipt Clearing Acct</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The RC and RB AAIs are included in this list, because, although not technically multicurrency AAIs, the business unit is mandatory for these as well.</p>

<a name="aref_section233"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Other AAI Related Issues</strong></h3>
<p>The following are some frequently asked questions related to troubleshooting AAI setup.</p>
<a name="aref_section234"></a><h4 class="km">Question 1: Why is the system using the Customer Master/Address Book Business Unit instead of the Invoice Business Unit for the account associated to an AAI when the AAI is not defined with a business unit.?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> While entering the receipt details and when the 'OK' button is clicked in the receipt entry form, the system validates the AAI setup for the specified account through the business function B0000055 (F0012 Get AAI Account Number). To this function the variable VA frm_CustomerBusinessUnit_MCU is passed which is fetched from the customer master. <br /> The system has to evaluate the business unit from the customer master only. This is because if an invoice is created for a customer the client can override the business unit for that invoice. For example, if 2 invoices are created with 2 different business units. And if a receipt is created and the same receipt is matched against with the above created 2 invoices. In that case, it is not possible for the system to map different business unit from two different invoices with a single receipt. <br /> Also, if an invoice is created with multiple pay items, and if each of the pay item is assigned with different business unit, in that case while matching any receipt with that invoice it is not possible for the system to map the business unit correctly. <br /> Due to this scenario, the system is designed in such a way that it has to take the business unit from the customer master and not from the invoice. <br /> Work around: Set up your AAI per company and populate BU, do not leave it blank.</p>

<a name="aref_section235"></a><h4 class="km">Question 2: When posting a batch, why do I get an error of "AE in Error &ndash; Posting Edit Code Does not Allow Entry" for a G/L account associated with an AAI?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Use Review and Revise Accounts (P0901) to check the Review the Posting Edit (PEC) for the AAIs involved. If you aren&rsquo;t sure which AAI is the issue, link to the section above for information.  The PEC value can be blank (allow all posting), but  accounts associated to AAIs are recommended to have a PEC of M for Machine generated; this is to make sure these accounts are not used for other types of transactions or erroneous journal entries, which will cause out of balance integrity issues..</p>

<a name="aref_section236"></a><h4 class="km">Question 3: Why is the post program not using the GL Offset defined on the customer master records for the  R8 AAI?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> The R8 AAI is not designed to be set up with a GL offset.</p>
