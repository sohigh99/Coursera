<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document provides an overview of adding a US Employee using the Employee Information application (P0801).  This document provides information on the series of forms that automatically display when adding a new employee record and addresses some specific scenarios that may be needed for some employees.</p>

<a name="aref_section32"></a><h4 class="km">Methods of Employee Record Entry</h4>
<p>When you hire an employee, you must add an employee record that contains personal, company, job, and pay information for the employee.  The information in the employee record can be used to analyze and report on your employees and to meet government reporting requirements.  You can add employee records to the database using either of two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding employee records one at a time</li>
<li>Adding multiple employee records</li>
</ul>
<p> This table describes the similarities and differences between the methods:</p>
<p> </p>

<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">
<p>Adding employee records one at a time</p>
</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">
<p>This method displays a series of forms that you need to complete to hire an employee.  This method is preferable if you hire individuals with very diverse employee information so that hiring in groups is not applicable.  You can use this method to add new employee and terminated employee (rehire) records to table Employee Master Information (F060116).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">
<p>Adding multiple employee records</p>
</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">
<p>This method uses the Employee Quick Hire program (P060116Q). It saves data entry time because you add records in groups based on similar job information.  You can use this method to add new employee, terminated employee (rehire), and applicant records to the F060116 table</p>
</td>

<p class="km"> </p>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note:  This document only covers the steps for adding employees one at a time.</div>
<a name="aref_section33"></a><h4 class="km">Understanding Employee Information</h4>
<p>Basic employee information includes general identification information about the employee.  You need this information to include the employee in payroll processing.  When you create a record for a new employee, the system stores information for the employee in the following tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee Master Information (F060116)</li>
<li>Employee Master Additional Information File (F060120)</li>
<li>Employee Master - International Data (F060117)</li>
<li>Employee Master - International Data Tag (F060117A)</li>
<li>Employee Jobs (F060118)</li>
<li>Address Book Master (F0101) </li>
</ul>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note:   When you add a new employee record to the database, you complete a series of forms. As you complete each form, the next form appears.  You can use the Back button to return to a previous form, where you can review or change information before saving the employee's record.  The system saves the new record only after you complete the entire sequence of forms.</div>
<p>After you create a record of employee information, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make changes, corrections, or updates.</li>
<li>Review the information as necessary.</li>
<li>Process a timecard for the employee.</li>
<li>Enroll the employee in benefits.</li>
<li>Process the employee in a payroll.</li>
<li>Terminate the employee.</li>
<li>Rehire the employee.</li>
</ul>
<a name="aref_section34"></a><h4 class="km">Record Reservation</h4>
<p>Before adding employees it is important to understand record reservation.  This is an optional functionality in JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Human Resources that prevents loss of data when two users simultaneously attempt to update the same record in the database.  When you activate record reservation for a particular program, only one user at a time can access a record in the table that the program uses for data storage. For example, assume that record reservation has been activated for the employee master group of programs (P0801). User 1 is updating salary information for an employee in the Employee Basic Compensation program (P0801CMP). At the same time, User 2 opens the Basic Compensation program and attempts to access the same employee record. User 2 receives an error message indicating that the employee record is reserved. The system prevents User 2 from gaining access to the record.  The record remains reserved until User 1 saves any changes and closes the program.</p>
<p>Two significant limitations to record reservation exist.  First, it can only be used for the following programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee/Personal (P0801EMP)</li>
<li>Employee Organizational Assignments (P0801ORG)</li>
<li>Employee Basic Compensation (P0801CMP)</li>
<li>Employee Eligibility, NDT, and Participation (P0801ELI)</li>
<li>Employee Payroll (P0801PRL)</li>
<li>Employee National and Fiscal Data - Australia (P75A0801)</li>
<li>Employee National and Fiscal Data - Canada (P0801CA)</li>
<li>National/Fiscal Data - Regional Information (P76M0801)</li>
<li>Employee National and Fiscal Data - USA (P0801US)</li>
</ul>
<p>And second, if you activate record reservation for any of the programs in the employee master group, it is activated for all the programs.</p>
<a name="aref_section35"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Employee Information (P0801)</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section36"></a><h4 class="km">Setting Processing Options for Employee Information (P0801)<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p class="km">Before adding an employee you should review the processing options for each program in this series of tasks.  They define how much information you must enter.  For example, processing options for organizational assignments define whether the Job Information table (F08001) supplies default job information when you add or change employee information.  In the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Address Book system, review the processing options for the Address Book Revisions program (P01012) to ensure that the tax ID is set to appear.Setting Processing Options for Employee Master (P0801)</p>
<p>Processing options enable you to specify the default processing for programs and reports.<strong> <br /></strong></p>
<p><em>Defaults Tab</em><strong> - </strong>Use these processing options to define the defaults for the Security Business Unit, Tax Area (Residence) and Tax Area (Work) fields.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> 1.  Security Business Unit - Specify whether the system updates the Address Book record for the employee with the security business unit that you enter on the Employee form (P0801EMP).  Values are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>1: Updates the Address Book.</li>
<li>0: Does not update the Address Book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">2.  Tax Area - Specify whether the Tax Area (Residence) and Tax Area (Work) fields are required fields when you add or change an employee record.  The JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Payroll system uses the tax area fields to calculate payroll taxes for employees.  Values are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>1:  Not required. select this option only if you are not using the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Payroll system to process payroll for employees.</li>
<li>0:  Required.  If you are using the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Payroll system, select this option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><em>Versions Tab</em><strong> - </strong>Use these processing options to define the versions that the system uses for Organizational Assignment, Basic Compensation, and Address Book Revision forms.</p>
<ol>
<li>Organizational Assignment Version - Specify the version of the program that you want to use when you add or change information on the Organizational Assignment form (P0801ORG).  If you leave this processing option blank, the system enters the default version, ZJDE0001.  When you define a version for Organizational Assignment, you can set processing options that control the type of default job information that you want the system to use on the Organizational Assignment form (P0801ORG) when you add or change an employee record.</li>
<li>Basic Compensation Version - Specify the version of the program that you want to use when you add or change information on the Basic Compensation form (P0801CMP).  If you leave this processing option blank, the system enters the default version, ZJDE0001.  When you define a version for Basic Compensation, you can set processing options that control information that the system needs when you have activated the salary change workflow process.</li>
<li>Address Book Version - Specify the version of the Address Book program (P01012) that the system uses when you add or change information on the Address Book Revision form.  If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses the default version, ZJDE0002.  When you define a version of the Address Book program, you can set processing options that control how the application functions.  For example, you can specify whether the form displays the Tax ID field.</li>
</ol>
<p><em> Termination Tab</em> - Use these processing options to define default codes that are supplied to various records when an employee is terminated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Candidate Req Status (candidate requisition status) - Specify a code from UDC 08/CN to indicate the candidate requisition status that you use to indicate that an employee record is no longer attached to a requisition.  This candidate requisition status must have DET entered in the special handling code field.  When you terminate an employee, the system uses the code that you define in this processing option to update the candidate requisition status for all of the requisitions that the employee filled.</li>
<li>Requisition Status - Use this processing option only if you have set up the System Options program (P05001S) to automatically create a new requisition when an employee is terminated.  Specify a code from UDC 08/RS to indicate the requisition status that you want to assign to the new requisition.  If you leave this processing option blank, the system does not create a new requisition when you terminate an employee.</li>
<li>Organizational Structure Type - Specify a code from UDC 01/TS to indicate the organizational structure type that you use to indicate the parent/child relationship between terminated employees and their supervisors.  The system uses the termination date to update the parent/child relationship.  If you leave this processing option blank, the system does not update the parent/child relationship between the terminated employee and the supervisor.</li>
<li>Applicant Status - Specify a code from UDC 08/AS to indicate the applicant status that you want to assign to terminated employees who will be returned to the applicant pool for future hiring considerations.  If you leave this processing option blank, the system does not assign an applicant status to the terminated employee.</li>
</ol>
<a name="aref_section37"></a><h4 class="km">Entering Employee Information - Employee (P0801EMP) </h4>
<p>In the Employee Information form the following fields can be completed:</p>
<p><strong><img src="../images/hr70.png" border="0" alt="Employee Information - Employee" title="Employee Information - Employee" hspace="0"/><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee No.</strong> - Enter an employee number, tax ID, or alternate number, depending on the employee number display mode that is set up in the Company Options program (P05001C) for company 00000.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate Employee No</strong> - Enter an alternate employee number, typically the number from the employee tracking system that your organization used prior to converting to the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne system.  To search using this number, preface the number with a slash (/).</li>
<li><strong>Security Business Unit</strong> - Enter a business unit number that secures the employee's record from unauthorized access.  Any user not authorized to access this business unit cannot access this employee's record.</li>
<li><strong>Home Company</strong> - Enter the company number where the employee records generally reside.</li>
<li><strong>Check Route Code</strong> - Enter a code from UDC 07/CR that specifies the check routing or mail-stop code.  Use this code to sequence the printing of payroll checks to facilitate their handling and delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Pay Frequency </strong>- Enter a code from UDC 07/PF that indicates how often an employee is paid.  Values are:
<ul>
<li>B: Biweekly</li>
<li>W: Weekly</li>
<li>S: Semimonthly</li>
<li>M: Monthly</li>
<li>A:  Annually</li>
<li>C:  European Annualized</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="_mce_tagged_br" style="margin-left: 60px;">The system uses the value in the Description-2 field on user-defined codes to indicate the number of pay periods per year and is used to calculate the amount per pay period for a salaried employee.</p>
<ul>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br"><strong>Pay Status</strong> - Enter the code used to indicate whether an employee's pay status is active or inactive. Codes for active pay status employees are numeric, and codes for inactive pay status employees are alphabetic. The system omits all employees with alphabetic pay status codes from the payroll run.</li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br"><strong>Employee Benefit Status</strong> - Enter a code from UDC 06/EA that specifies an employee status, such as new hire or rehire.  The system uses this value as it searches and tests for benefits eligibility.  An asterisk (*) indicates that the guidelines refer to all employee statuses that are not otherwise specified.  <em>Do not change the codes that are hard-coded, such as A (Active) and X (Terminated).These are required codes in the system.</em></li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br"><strong>Benefit Group</strong> - Enter the benefit group to which the employee is assigned.  Benefit groups facilitate employee enrollment by categorizing benefit plans and allowing enrollment rules for those categories.  For example, assigning an employee to an executive (EXEC) benefit group automatically links the employee to the benefits available to executives in your organization.</li>
<li class="_mce_tagged_br"><strong>Participation Date</strong> &ndash; Enter the date the employee began participating in the company deferred income or stock option plan.  This date must be later than the date in the Date Started field.</li>
<li><strong>Original Hire Date</strong> - Enter the date on which the employee was originally hired by the company.  If the employee was terminated and subsequently rehired, the new start date will be represented by the data in the Date Started field (DST).</li>
<li><strong>Date Started</strong> - Enter the date on which the employee actually reported to work for the most recent period of hire. When an employee initially begins working, the default is the original hire date. If no original hire date exists, the system uses the current date.  This field can be updated multiple times if, for example, an employee is a seasonal worker.</li>
</ul>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note:  For the calculation tables in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Payroll system and the eligibility tables and date codes in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Human Resources system, the system also uses this date as a start date when it calculates deductions, benefits, and accruals.</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leave Begin Date</strong> -  If applicable, enter date on which an employee's paid or unpaid leave of absence begins. Use this date to indicate the leave for the Family and Medical Leave Act.  If you are using Position Control, the system enters a leave of absence as unpaid leave and adjusts the projected year-end calculations accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Leave End Date</strong> - If applicable, the date on which an employee's paid or unpaid leave of absence expires.  If you are using Position Control, the system enters a leave of absence as unpaid leave and adjusts the projected year-end calculations accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Recall Date</strong> - If applicable, enter the date on which the employee can be recalled for employment.</li>
<li><strong>Termination Date</strong> - If applicable, enter the date that the employee was terminated.</li>
<li><strong>Day Pay Start</strong>s - The date that an employee may begin participating in the company's benefit plans or may be included in payroll processing.  You can also use this field to provide a beginning date for seasonal employees or for employees who work only part of the year (such as a teacher who works only nine months of the year).</li>
<li><strong>Date Pay Stops</strong> - The date when an employee should no longer be included in a payroll cycle or the date when an employee stops participating in the company's benefit plans.  You can use this date for terminated employees, seasonal employees, or employees who work only part of the year (such as a teacher who works only nine months of the year). See also data item PSDT.  This date may also be the date that a deduction, benefit, or accrual instruction stops.</li>
<li><strong>Data Protection Code</strong> - Enter a code from UDC 05/DP to indicate the status of the employee's agreement for the transmission of his or her personal data outside of his or her work country.</li>
<li><strong>Data Protection Date</strong> - Enter the date on which the data protection code was last updated.</li>
<li><strong>Move to Applicant Pool</strong> - Enter a code that you use to indicate whether a terminated employee should be moved into the applicant pool.  When you move an employee to the applicant pool, the system changes the employee search type to applicant (A).  If you do not move the employee to the applicant pool, the system changes the employee search type to terminated (X).  If the applicant table does not exist, the system always changes the employee search type to terminated (X).</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong> - Enter a value that specifies the country for which the system displays country-specific forms and fields.  For example, for an employee whose country code is CA (Canada), the system displays the National and Fiscal Data form for Canada, where you can enter information that applies to Canadian employees only, such as national occupational classification. For employees whose country code is US (United States), the system displays the National and Fiscal data form for the United States.  You must enter a value in this field.  Blank is not a value.</li>
</ul>
<a name="aref_section38"></a><h4 class="km">Address Book Revisions</h4>
<p>After you enter basic employee information, you must enter address book information.  When you enter an address book record for an employee, the system automatically enters an E (employee) in the Search Type field.  If you are entering a record for a subcontractor, you must manually enter an S in that field.</p>

<p>After you complete the Personal form, you must enter organizational assignment information.  Organizational assignment information includes detailed information about the employee's work assignment, such as job type, job step, home business unit, performance appraisal types and dates, and employee competency levels.  When you want to review job history for values on this form, first place the cursor in the desired field and then select the Job Hist. Tracking (form exit menu option).  To review history for other values on this form that you might be tracking, place the cursor in the desired field and then select the History Tracking (form exit menu option). Use the <span id="jdeFormTitle0" style="overflow-x: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;" title="Work With History Data Items">Work With History Data Items</span> (P08041) to set up the historical information data values that you want to track.<br /><br />If you are using the Performance Appraisal module in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Human Resources system to create employee appraisals, the system automatically updates the Last Review Type and Last Review Date fields on the Organizational Assignment form when an appraisal is completed. You can then review the employee's appraisal directly from the Work With Organizational Assignment form using the Performance Appraisal (row exit menu option).  For example, if a dispute arose about the level of an employee's salary, a human resource administrator could easily review the employee's record, and also access the employee's performance appraisal directly, to ensure that all necessary information is taken into account.  If no appraisals have been created for the employee, the Performance Appraisal option is disabled.</p>
<p>You can also review current and historical performance appraisals that were completed by a specified supervisor.  On the Work With Organizational Assignments form, you choose an employee who is assigned to the specified supervisor, and then select the Performance Appraisal (row exit menu option). You can select any employee who is associated with that supervisor, regardless of whether that employee has a completed performance appraisal.  For example, human resource administrators might need to verify whether a supervisor has completed all of the performance appraisals for the department.  Using this option, you can review all completed appraisals, or all appraisals that have not yet been completed by a specified supervisor.</p>
<a name="aref_section311"></a><h4 class="km">Setting Processing Options for Employee Organizational Assignments (P0801ORG)</h4>
<p><em>Defaults Tab</em> - Use these processing options to determine what default job-related information the system uses to fill in the employee master information record when you add or change the job type for an employee.  The program uses default information from the Job Information table (F08001) and the Business Unit / Job ID. X-Ref table (F08005), depending on which combination of processing options is set.</p>
<p>The Job Information Add and Job Information Change processing options use data in the F08001 table unless the Business Unit/Job ID Information processing options are set to 1 (default). When the Business Unit/Job ID Information Add and Business Unit/Job ID Information Change processing options are set to 1 and there is a matching business unit / job type record in the F08005 table, the union code, benefit group, and workers compensation information comes from the F08005 table. All other data comes from the F08001 table.  If there is no matching business unit/job type record in the F08005 table, all data comes from the F08001 table.</p>
<p>The Job Category Add and Job Category Change processing options use data in the F08001 table if a matching job type/step record exists in that table.  If no matching record exists, no data is used and no data is retrieved for the Job Information Add and Job Information Change processing options.</p>
<p>The Job Default Window processing options specify the setting that the system uses to automatically provide information from the F08001 table for the Job Default Window program (P08JD).  The system displays the Job Default Window only when you are entering a new employee into the system.</p>

<li><strong>Std Hrs/Year (standard hours/year)</strong>- Enter the number of work hours in the year.  When you do not set the HRM Foundation Position Control Options to use the Pay Grade Step table as the pay-rate source, the system uses this number to compute the hourly rate when you supply the annual salary (or to compute the annual salary when you supply the hourly rate).  When you set the HRM Foundation Position Control Options to use the Pay Grade Step table as the pay rate source, the system uses this sequence to search for the standard number of hours that it uses to calculate the salary or hourly rate per pay period:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Employee entry forms (this field).</li>
<li>Pay Grade Step table (hours per day multiplied by days per year).</li>

<li>N:  The employee does not fit the rules and is to be paid for working overtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Std Days/Year (standard days/year</strong>) - Enter the number of workdays in a year. The number of standard days per year multiplied by the number of hours per day equals the standard hours per year.  When you set up the System Options program (P05001S) and to use the pay grade step table as the default source for the pay rate, the system calculates the salary for an employee by multiplying the standard days per year by the employee's hourly rate.</li>
<li><strong><strong>FTE (full-time equivalent)</strong> - </strong>Enter the full-time equivalent (FTE) amount.  This figure is the portion of a full-time worker that an employee represents within the business unit.  For example, an employee who works 20 hours per week would represent .50 (1/2 FTE).  This number cannot be greater than 1 for any employee.</li>
<li><strong>Default Auto Pay Type</strong> - Enter a code that specifies the default pay type to be used in the generation of autopay in those instances where the system does not use the employee labor distribution instructions.

<li><strong>Residency Status (WSPS)</strong>- Enter a value that identifies out-of-state employees for whom an employer must withhold tax for the state of residence. Values are:
<ul>
<li>N:  Uses the employee residence state to calculate taxes. Because the work state has a reciprocal agreement with the employee state of residence, the system uses the employee residence state from the Employee Master Information table (F060116).  This is the default value.</li>
<li>W:  Uses only the work state to calculate taxes. If the Work/Residence tax areas are the same for an employee then the WSPS must not be set to 'W' otherwise no state taxes will be calculated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marital Status (Federal</strong>) - Enter a code from UDC 06/MS that specifies the employees' federal marital status code as retrieved from the W-4 form.  This code is used in the computation of all federal income tax.  You can add codes if needed.</li>

If a form is not specified in Description 2, the system generates IRS Form W-2.  For employees who are paid multiple times within one pay period, the system should review previous payments within the same pay period and then adjust tax amounts.  To specify this function, enter S.  If a tax method exists for an employee in addition to the normal tax method that is set up in the Employee Master Information table (F060116), the system can use the alternative tax method to interactively process interim payments.  To specify this function, enter Z.  <em>Some values, such as S and Z, might require additional setup in the UDC table.</em></li>
<li><strong>Marital Status (Resident)</strong> - Enter a code from UDC 06/MS that specifies the marital status code for the state of residence.  This code is used for tax computations.

<p>After you complete the Change Reason form, you can enter tax withholding and override information for a new employee or change existing employee information.  When you need to change tax withholding and override information that has already been entered, you can select Employee Tax Overrides - USA from the Employee Management menu (G05BE1).   You enter tax withholding and override information to indicate the number and type of exemptions that employees claim on their withholding allowance forms. Quantum for Payroll Tax, the tax calculation system that integrates with the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Payroll system, uses this information to calculate employees' taxes each pay period.  The system provides the tax area and tax type for federal income tax (tax type A) with no exemptions and no override withholding amount.  If the employee has any exemptions, you must enter the number of exemptions.  The system uses the number of federal exemptions to calculate all taxes unless you enter separate override records for state and local taxes.</p>
