<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document discusses frequently asked questions regarding Standard Voucher Entry (P0411) Within EnterpriseOne Accounts Payable (Non-Purchase Order Related).</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Standard Voucher Entry (P0411) Questions <br /></strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> How is the remark field populated for a standard voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> When changing gross amount for a posted voucher, the original line is marked as paid (pay status=P) and remark Change in gross amount and a new line is added for the new gross amount value.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong><span id="form1:panelPage1">Is it possible to enter vouchers for a zero amount? </span></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong><span id="form1:panelPage1">Voucher can be entered with a zero Gross Amount (AG). For these particular lines/vouchers, the system creates the voucher as already Paid because there is a zero Open A</span><span id="form1:panelPage1">mount (AAP) as well.</span><strong><span id="form1:panelPage1"> </span><br /> </strong></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:  </strong>Is there a specific setup for mapping the Voucher Entry Master Business Function (B0400047)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3: </strong>The Voucher Entry Master Business Function (B0400047) must be mapped to the same server as all the other business functions for that application when the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are working in a Web (HTML) or Windows Terminal Server (WTS) environment;</li>
<li>The Intercompany Settlement option is set to 2 - Flex Create Intercompany without Hub in the General Accounting Constants; and</li>
<li>The Allow Multi-Currency Intercompany Transactions option is checked in the General Accounting Constants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within voucher applications, portions of the Voucher Entry process asynchronously. For example, when using Standard Voucher Entry, records are committed to the database when the user clicks the OK button. The Voucher Master Business Function controls the database update. After the user clicks the OK button, the Master Business Function is launched asynchronously, yet the application refreshes and allows the user to start entering the next voucher. From the user's perspective, processing has completed successfully. From a business function perspective, the Master Business Function is waiting to finish its processing. The business function will continue to wait if functions are not mapped correctly in the HTML or WTS environments causing the process to enter an endless loop. Mapping the business function to run in the same location as the application alleviates this situation.<br /> <br /> The Voucher Master Business Function (B0400047) controls most additions and modifications to the Supplier Ledger (F0411) that are part of voucher entry. However, when a user (or a UBE report) creates a voucher transaction that has a domestic voucher side, but contains a foreign G/L distribution account, additional processing becomes necessary. After vouchers that contain these properties are written to the F0411 by the Master Business Function, a second function (Update F0411 with Multi Currency - N0400137) is called to update all pay items in that transaction with a particular value. The actual update sets the F0411 RPDMCD = 1. When mapped to a different server, the business function N0400137 will not be able to update the records just created by B0400047 due to record-locking constraints. There are no workarounds for this situation available at this time.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="ChangeVhrGLDate"></a>Question 4: </strong>Is it possible to change a Voucher's GL Date?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> After a voucher has been entered, the GL Date (data dictionary item DGJ) cannot be changed even if the voucher has not been posted because the GL Date is one of several key fields in the Accounts Payable Ledger (F0411) table. Other fields that cannot be changed after voucher entry are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document Number (data dictionary item DOC).</li>
<li>Document Type (data dictionary item DCT).</li>
<li>Company (data dictionary item CO).</li>
<li>Supplier Number (data dictionary item ALKY).</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these fields need to be changed, the voucher must be deleted or voided and reentered as a new voucher.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5: </strong>When creating additional vouchers via Voucher Journal Review (P0011), since there is no processing option to indicate the version for business function P0400047, which version will be used?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> It had been hard coded to read from version ZJDE0001.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="BUpurpose"></a>Question 6:</strong> What is the purpose of the Business Unit (BU) field in the Header of a Voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong> The Business Unit (BU) field on the header of a voucher does not generally impact AAI validation or the posting of a voucher. This field is mostly used for reporting purposes. However, if the PC or PB AAI do not have a business unit defined for the account, the business unit in the header of the voucher is used in conjunction with the Object Account (OBJ) to determine the account number for posting.</p>
<p>Business Unit is a alphanumeric code. This indicates the business unit of  source transactions. Business units are part of the basic account structure in the JD Edwards Enterprise One General Accounting system and denote where transactions affect the organization, such as a warehouse or store. They are the lowest reporting level within your organization at which you need to account for assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. You can assign a business unit to a document, entity, or person for purposes of responsibility reporting. For example, the system provides reports of open accounts payable and accounts receivable by business unit to track equipment by responsible department. Business unit security might prevent you from viewing information about business units for which you have no authority. Note that this field is also used in the tax calculation of voucher and to identify the &ldquo;Property Unit No&rdquo; in Real Estate module.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7: </strong>Where is the Payment Instrument (PYIN) field in standard voucher entry (P0411)?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 7: </strong>The Payment Instrument (data dictionary item PYIN) field can be found by taking the Additional Information Form Exit when entering the standard voucher (P0411).</p>
<hr />
<p class="km"> </p>
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong> Why are the voucher header fields grayed out (locked) when entering pay item information in the detail grid?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8:</strong> EnterpriseOne Voucher Entry application (P0411) is designed to lock all the header fields when adding information in the detail grid line (with the exception of the Invoice number).  If the user wants to change the header information (such as the currency code, exchange rate, GL date, Payment Terms, etc), they will need to cancel out of the voucher and key the information in again.  <br /> <br /> If the header fields were allowed to be changed, there is the risk of creating data integrity issues.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Altering the Company could create issues with currency and accounting information.</li>
<li>Altering the Supplier Number could create issues with currency and tax information.</li>
<li>Altering the GL Date or the Invoice Date could create issues with the due date and discount due date.</li>
<li>Altering the Currency fields could create issues with the calculation of the domestic and foreign amounts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:</strong> Why is the Pay Status (PST) creating with a default of %?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 9:</strong> The % Pay Status is hard-coded to be used with Withholding Tax functionality, which is set up in the Supplier Master (P04012) on  the Tax tab. More information on Withholding can be found in KM <a href='../docs/645212.html'>How To Set Up Supplier Withholding (R04580) </a>.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong> Why is the Copy button disabled in one of the versions of Standard Voucher Entry (P0411)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10:</strong> If Processing Option 1: Voucher Entry Mode on the Processing tab of Standard Voucher Entry (P0411) is set to a 1, the Copy and Delete buttons are disabled. Furthermore, the Attachments Row Exit is also disabled.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong> What causes the system to display "Not in Original Mode of Entry ERROR" when the Foreign option is unchecked on a voucher in Voucher Entry (P0411)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11:</strong> While reviewing a foreign voucher, if the foreign option is unchecked system displays this error message 'Not in Original Mode of Entry ERROR' to indicate that you are trying to view a foreign voucher in domestic currency mode. The foreign option should not be unchecked for a foreign voucher while reviewing, to avoid this error.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12: </strong><span id="form1:panelPage1">What is the purpose of the "Payments" button in Supplier Ledger Inquiry (P0411)? </span></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12: </strong><span id="form1:panelPage1">The &ldquo;Payments&rdquo; button in Supplier Ledger Inquiry (P0411) opens A/P Manual Payments (P0413M), form Work with Payments (W0413MB). If a row is selected in P0411, the Supplier Number will be passed on to P0413M.</span></p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13:</strong> How exactly is the Subledger (SBL) field populated in Supplier Ledger (F0411) table?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 13:</strong> Currently, value of Subledger in F0411 table cannot be updated by any AP interfaces including P0411, P041016 and P041017 etc. This is also not updated by 3 way or 2 way voucher match process in Procurement module. The SBL Subledger field in F0411 table can only be populated via following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voucher Batch Processing (R04110ZA). Please do note that there is no column available in P0411Z1 application to process SBL data entry into F0411Z1 table and it would be required to specify Subledger values via custom processes to upload the F0411Z1 table.</li>
<li>Manual Billing Process (if you are using Real Estate module).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 14:</strong> Is it possible to enter purchase order information (P.O. No/Typ/Co) while entering a voucher in P0411?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 14</strong>:Yes, this is possible by using the Form Exit to Additional Info while creating the new voucher. But when the Purchase Order info is added in that way, the P.O. Number will only exist in the Supplier Ledger (F0411) table and there will be no info in the Purchasing module tables(e.g. F43121, F4311, F4301).</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 15:</strong> Does the AP Constants Duplicate Invoice Number apply to voided vouchers?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 15:</strong> No. When entering a voucher with the same Invoice Number (VINV) as a previously voided voucher, with the Duplicate Invoice Number set to H (Hard error upon duplication) or Y (Warning upon duplication), the system does not issue a warning / error. This is working as designed, otherwise users would not be able to re-enter a voucher that was previously voided with the correct Invoice Number and would be required to change the VINV on the voided voucher.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 16: </strong>Why are PE (adjusting) entries not included in the Cumulative Total Gross Amount  on the Supplier Ledger Inquiry (P0411)?<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 16: </strong>When creating a PE entry, the actual amount of a voucher is directly changed so when viewing a PE entry in the Supplier Ledger Inquiry the PE entry will not be included as it is already included in the original voucher gross amount.   For example:<br />&bull;    Create a voucher for 100.00 post the voucher.<br />&bull;    Inquire on the voucher and change the gross amount to 130.00.<br />&bull;    A PE entry will be created in the F0411 for 30.00, but when viewing directly in the P0411 Supplier Ledger inquiry will see 130.00.   Therefore; if the PE entry is included it will overstate the Total Gross Amount.<br />&bull;    Or if a credit amount, voucher is 100.00.   <br />&bull;    Inquire on the voucher and adjust to 0.00.   When reviewing in the F0411, the Total Gross for the PV will be 0.00, but a PE entry will appear in the F0411.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section218"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 17:</strong> Which field in P0411 determines what will show in the GLEXA field in the F0911 for the payment record tied to the voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 17:</strong> The GLEXA field on a payment record is populated with the supplier's alpha name.  There is no specific field that can be populated in P0411 that will change this.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section219"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 18:</strong> At what point during the voucher entry process are the F0411 and F0911 records inserted into the tables?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 18:</strong> The F0411 and F0911 records are inserted into the tables when the okay (select) button is clicked on the GL Distribution screen.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section220"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 19:</strong> Is it possible to create a voucher with a positive amount that has document type PD?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 19:</strong> Yes, it is possible to enter any document type when creating a voucher in Standard Voucher Entry (P0411).</p>

<a name="aref_section222"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong>How is the Tax Table (F0018) populated when creating a voucher with taxes?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> The Tax Table (F0018) can be populated two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically while vouchers are posting, by setting Processing Option 1: Update Tax File on the Taxes tab of the General Ledger Post (R09801) to a '1'.</li>
<li>Manually using the Work with Tax File (P0018) program.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section223"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong>Why are the tax fields not recalculated when changing the Gross Amount on a voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong>To have the system recalculate the tax amounts, the existing values in the Taxable Amount (data dictionary item ATXA) and Tax Amount (data dictionary item STAM) fields must be blanked out.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section224"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong>When are the Tax Variance Amount and Tax Variance Percentage calculated for a VAT tax voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> The Tax Variance Amount (data dictionary item TXVA) and Tax Variance Percentage (data dictionary item TXVR) are only populated in the Taxes table (F0018) when there is difference between the calculated VAT amount and the Tax Amount (data dictionary item STAM) entered by the user during voucher creation. To ensure the Taxes table (F0018) is updated, verify that Processing Option 1: Update Tax File on the Taxes tab of the General Ledger Post (R09801) is not set to blank.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section225"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong>Can the Non-Recoverable Tax Amount field in the grid be changed to accessible?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4: </strong>The design of the application does not allow access to the Non-Recoverable field.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section226"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> what can cause the error Tax Explanation Code Invalid?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> This is caused when the tax explanation code is not valid, or if blanking out the tax explanation code, the taxable amount calculated by the system remains in the header, in which case it needs to also be blanked out</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section227"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Standard Vouchers With Multi Currency Questions<br /></strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section228"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong>When inquiring on outstanding vouchers in Supplier Ledger Inquiry (P0411), why are gross totals not displayed for all suppliers?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> If totals are not displayed for a supplier, it is because their outstanding transactions have different Base Currency Codes (data dictionary item BCRC).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section229"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong>Can multiple vouchers be entered in different foreign currencies within the same batch?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Yes. If you enter vouchers with different currencies in the same batch, the system does not adjust for the decimal places of the different currencies. As a result, the totals for the batch are meaningless. If Batch Control is activated (P0000) the debit amounts of the entries are added to obtain the batch total. To determine the expected total for a batch with currencies that have different decimal places, add the amounts without using a decimal point and enter the amount in the Total Expected field on the Batch Control form.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section230"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong>What are the considerations for entering a voucher with a monetary bank account?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3: </strong>The currency of the monetary bank account has to be the same as the transaction currency for foreign transactions.  The base currency of the company associated with the bank account must be the same as the base currency for domestic transactions.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section231"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong>When reviewing an existing batch, only the domestic amounts appear on the screen, can the foreign amounts be shown?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4: </strong>Yes, P0411 has a check box called Foreign on the header, if this is checked, the foreign amounts are displayed.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section232"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> How to turn off the foreign check mark on the Voucher Entry screen (P0411), as it is defaulted to checked every time the transaction is created?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> Foreign filter is the CRRM-Currency Mode-Foreign or Domestic Entry data item which has as default value equal to F, see P92001-Data Item Specifications setup for CRRM, Default Value tab. So when the flag is checked, the value is F but once the transaction is entered, the application decides whether it is foreign or domestic depending on the currency of the transaction and the base currency of the company and leaves the field checked if transaction is foreign or unchecked if transaction is domestic.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section233"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Negative Voucher (aka Debit Memo Doc Type PD) Questions<br /></strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section234"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="Supplierrefund"></a>Question 1: </strong>How do I enter a Supplier Refund?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> The refund can either be recorded in General Accounting or in Accounts Payable.The benefit of using Accounts Payable is the creation of an audit trail. This audit trail can be tracked through Supplier Ledger Inquiry (P0411).  The following show how this can be processed in Accounts Payable or General Accounting when receiving a check from a supplier.  </p>
<ol>
<li>In Accounts Payable, create a debit amount (debit memo) for this refund total. Enter a negative check through Manual Payments with Voucher Match (P0413M). The processing option on the Processing tab to allow negative payments must be set to one. This credits the expense account, debits the bank account for the refund received, and closes the debit memo to prevent it from being processed in a future check run. Post the payment. No physical check is created for this transaction.</li>
<li>In General Accounting, a journal entry is created to update the expense and cash account</li>
</ol>

<a name="aref_section235"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Deleting or Voiding Standard Vouchers Questions</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section236"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong>Why is there no reversing AE (Automatic Entry) record created in the General Ledger table (F0911) when a voucher with a gross amount of zero is voided?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> When voiding a posted voucher with a gross amount equal to zero, the system does not create any reversing entry in the Accounts Payable Ledger table (F0411). Therefore, when the voided voucher is posted, there are no AE entries created in the General Ledger table (F0911).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section237"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong>When inquiring on a voided voucher in the Standard Voucher Entry application (P0411), why is only the original voucher with a blank gross amount displayed?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> As of EnterpriseOne release 8.11, PE adjusting records are no longer displayed on the Supplier Ledger Inquiry application (P0411). As a result of a performance improvement project, audit memo records for voids and changes in gross amount are no longer displayed in the Supplier Ledger Inquiry form (W0411G). To allow users to display records with Adjusting Document Type (DCTA) equal to PE (i.e. audit memo records), a Display Audit checkbox has been added to the application. When Display Audit is checked, PE records meeting the other search criteria are displayed. As before, these PE amounts will not be included in any grid totals.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE:  The Display Audit checkbox is automatically disabled when the Summarize option is checked.</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section238"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="ReverseVoid"></a>Question 3: </strong>Is it possible to reverse the void of a voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> No.  The system cannot reverse the void of a voucher. Once an item is voided, you cannot reverse the void to go back to the original status regardless of whether or not the void of the voucher is posted. A new voucher will need to be entered to replace the voided voucher.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section239"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong>Is it possible to void a voucher's Pay Items using a GL date different than the voucher's GL date?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> The delete function from the Enter Voucher - Payment Information form (W0411A) in the Standard Voucher Entry application (P0411) does not allow individual pay items to be voided with a different GL Date from the rest of the voucher's pay items. The delete function only allows the entire voucher (all pay items) to be voided with a different GL Date. Therefore, the void GL Date is only enabled when voiding the entire voucher and is disabled when voiding a single pay item.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section240"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="Voidpartiallypaidvhr"></a>Question 5: </strong>Is it possible to void a partially paid voucher or a single pay item on a partially paid voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:  </strong>No.  Pay Items within a Voucher share the same Key fields, therefore, you can only void the entire Voucher.  This means you must void the payment first, post the void of the payment, then void your Voucher.   You can re-enter a voucher and payment if the original payment was already mailed and cashed to keep the accounts in balance.  If you are not able to or allow to void the payment, you can enter in a PD Debit Voucher for the reverse total of the pay item(s) you need to reverse out, create a manual payment to net to zero dollars and post it. Note - To allow Manual Payment With Voucher match to create zero or negative payment you must flag the processing option. </p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section241"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6: </strong>How is the remark field (data dictionary item RPRMK) in the Accounts Payable Ledger table (F0411) populated for a voided voucher?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong> The remark field of the voided pay item is populated as Change in gross amount. The system does not copy the remark from the original pay item.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section242"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:</strong> Is it possible to void an entire batch of Vouchers in one step?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 7:</strong> No, each voucher must be voided one at the time. After all the vouchers have been posted, it is necessary to post the batch again (R09801).</p>
