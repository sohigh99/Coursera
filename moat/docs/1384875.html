<p>This document provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding EFT Processing, Outbound Interoperability Payment and Payment Register.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Payment General/Setup Questions<br /></strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong> What is the purpose of the Pre-Note Code when using EFT payments?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1: </strong> The Pre-Note Code checkbox (data dictionary item AB1) located in the Supplier Master (P04012) indicates how supplier payments are written. The two different processes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the checkbox is checked:</li>
<ul>
<li>A physical (live) check is created.</li>
<li>The pre-note is cleared automatically after the payment has been updated.</li>
<li>The AP Payment Tape (F04572OW) file is created with a zero amount that can be sent to the bank for verification.</li>
<li>The next numbers used in this scenario are coming from: the bank account for the physical check, and from the Check No. ACH line of the Accounts Payable Next Numbers (P0002) for the verification file.</li>
<li>The Document Type (data dictionary item DCT) of the payment is PK.</li>
</ul>
<li>If the checkbox is unchecked:</li>
<ul>
<li>The AP Payment Tape table (F04572OW) is created for submission to the bank.</li>
<li>The next number is retrieved from the Check No. ACH line of the Accounts Payable Next Numbers (P0002). The bank account number displayed during the Write status is not used.</li>
<li>The Document Type (DCT) of the payment is PT.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong> What are the lines filled with 9s after record 8 used for in the AP Payment Tape table (F04572OW) for CTX format?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong> Lines starting with number 9 are called File Control Records and are the final record set in the CTX (Corporate Trade Exchange) format. These lines are mandatory and denote the end of the CTX file. Without this record, the bank will not process the CTX payment format successfully. It represents the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record Type code</li>
<li>Batch Count</li>
<li>Block Count</li>
<li>Entry/Addenda count</li>
<li>Entry Hash</li>
<li>Total Debit Entry Dollar Amount in file</li>
<li>Total Credit Entry Dollar Amount in file</li>
<li>Reserved</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong>  Is it possible to use a different payment instrument than the default setup in the Supplier Master?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong>  Yes.  The payment instrument (PYIN) can be entered at the time of voucher entry (P0411), or it can be changed by using speed release (P0411S) before the payment group is created.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong> Does EnterpriseOne provide the capability to send e-mail notifications to suppliers with payment details?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> One can leverage the BI Publisher and JD Edwards integration. As of Tools Release 8.98 one can setup Report Definitions and use the Data Driven E-Mail feature. See more on how to set a Report Definition to e-mail the Payment Print PDF to the Suppliers in <a href="../docs/1908922.html" target="_blank">How to e-mail Accounts Payable Payment Print PDFs to Suppliers using Report Definitions</a>)</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5: </strong> Does EnterpriseOne support the PPD format?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong>  Yes.  The PPD format is available as of EnterpriseOne release 8.9. To use this format, set a payment instrument to use the Payment Print Program P04572T1 in the Work with Default Payment Instrument Defaults program (P0417).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6: </strong> Can the EFT Remittance Advice be reprinted?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong>  Yes.  There is an option  using  Manual Payment with Voucher Match (P0413M) application.  To reprint the Remittance Advice use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Manual Payment with Voucher Match (P0413M) Processing Options, set the Payment Instrument option under the Print tab to the payment instrument used for Electronic Payments (ACH/EFT).</li>
<li>Open the Manual Payment with Voucher Match application and inquire on the Payment Number.</li>
<li>Drill into the payment and flag the field&rdquo; Print Payment &ldquo;.  Click OK.</li>
<li>Go to WSJ and find the R04572T2 PDF</li>
</ol>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note: Reprinting the EFT creates a payment file in the A/P Payment Tape (F04572OW) table, which will need to be removed using a database utility tool.</div>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:</strong>  Where is the File ID Modifier (as per the R04572T2 processing options) updated?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 7: </strong> The File ID Modifier is written in the 34th position under the field name KNAPTA in the A/P Payment Tape table (F04572OW).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong>  Is there a way to mask the bank account number on the Remittance Advice PDF?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8: </strong> The standard EnterpriseOne solution does not provide this functionality.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:</strong>  Is it possible to use different versions of the P04572T1 for different G/L Bank Accounts?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 9:</strong>  This setup can be achieved by creating different versions for the EFT payment instrument for the different G/L Bank Accounts in the Work with Payment Instrument Defaults program (P0417). Each payment instrument record can specify a different version of the P04572T1 in the Print Version (data dictionary item PVN) field.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10: </strong> How is the next payment number determined for Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10: </strong> When writing EFT payments, the system displays the next payment number from the GL bank account information (P0030G). However, this number is not used. EFT payments use the Accounts Payable Next Numbers for ACH from the Work with Next Number (P0002) application.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE:  To prevent the Next Payment Number (data dictionary item NXTC) field in the Bank Account Information (P0030G) from being updated, verify that the Special Handling Code for the EFT Payments Program (R04572x) is set to 2 in UDC table 04/PP (Produce Bank File).</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong>  Is it possible to reset the payment number used for EFT payments?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11: </strong> To reset the payment number used for EFT Payments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Work with Next Numbers (P0002).</li>
<li>Select Accounts Payable (System 04).</li>
<li>Change the value for Check No.-ACH.</li>
</ol>
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE:  Although it is possible to change the payment number used for EFT payments, it is not recommended to do so because it could lead to duplicate payment numbers.</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12: </strong> Which payment methods use the pre-note code?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12: </strong> The pre-note code is only used for R04572T2 (CTX) and R04572T1 (PPD) format. Other electronic payment formats (for example localizations) do not use the pre-note code. Check formats never use the pre-note code.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13: </strong>How is the '7 ' record formatted for the CTX payment format and what is the information stored after *CK* string in the text file?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 13: </strong>After '*ZZZ\REF*CK*' string in the text file, the payment number is inserted.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 14:</strong> What field is used to print the Supplier information on the Bank Tape?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 14:</strong> The EFT programs use the Alpha Name (ALPH) in Address Book (P01012) to populate that Supplier information in the bank tape file.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 15:</strong> Is it possible to select a delimited character when creating the EFT payment file using R04572T1 or R04572T2?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 15:</strong> JD Edwards EnterpriseOne does not provide an option to select a specific delimited character to be inserted in the electronic payment file (F04572OW) when running R04572T1 or R04572T2.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 16:</strong> Is the payment next number warning message relevant if using an EFT print program?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 16:</strong> The following warning message that pops up in Work with Payment Group - Check Number (P04572|W04572D) screen appears despite the payment instrument being used: "If this check write process does not run to completion, you may want to reset the next available check number to avoid out-of-sequence check numbers." In the case of EFT payments, changing the number on this screen does not change the next number used for the payments created and the warning message is irrelevant.<strong><br /> </strong></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section218"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 17:</strong> Where are the values for Duns and EIN stored, which is used by Processing Option 4 of the R04572T2?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 17:</strong> The DUNS number is maintained in the Address Book Master (P01012) under the Additional 2 tab. The EIN number is also in the Address Book Master (P01012) but is saved in the Tax ID (TAX) field.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section219"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 18:</strong> What payment formats are available for localizations?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 18:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">For details on localization payment formats check JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Globalizations: Localizations, Translations, Certifications/Registrations (Doc ID 752291.1) under Details and Announcements columns for each specific localization. <br /></span></p>
<hr>
<a name="aref_section220"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 19:</strong> Is it possible to process an EFT file (F04572T) containing more than one bank account?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 19:</strong> Yes, set processing option #2 in the PRINT tab behind P04571 to '1' to separate the file by bank account.<span id="form1:panelPage1"></span></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section221"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 20:</strong> Is it possible to send the EFT Remittance Advice Electronically to the bank?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 20:</strong> No, the system does not currently have the functionality to send an electronic copy of the EFT Remittance Advice to the bank. It is possible to send the file via email using BI Publisher. This functionality is discussed in Doc ID 652988.1.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section222"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 21:</strong> If the Pre-Note Code is activated on the Supplier Master (F0401) record for a supplier, and the payment instrument for this supplier is set to call R04572T2 (via Payment Instrument Defaults (P0417)), where does the Standard Check Print (R04572) version come from?</h4>
<p>Note: the payment instrument pointing to R04572T2 is not the blank payment instrument, but T for example.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 21:</strong> R04572 will use a version with the same name as the version defined for R04572T2 in P0417. For example given the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a version of R04572T2 is set up and is called TEST0001</li>
<li>this version is set up for the R04572T2 payment instrument in P0417</li>
<li>the Pre-Note Code for a supplier is checked on the Supplier Master record (F0401)</li>
</ul>
<p>When writing the payment group created for this supplier&rsquo;s vouchers with this payment instrument, Work with Payment Groups (P04571) will try to find a R04572 version called TEST0001. If it exists, R04572 TEST0001 is called. </p>
<p>If it does not exist, R04572 ZJDE0001 is called.</p>

<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section228"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong> What causes EFT payments with a supplier's Pre-Note Code unchecked to increment both the ACH Next Number and the Bank Account's Next Payment Number?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong>  It is possible that the Special Handling Code (data dictionary item SPHD) for the EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) print program is incorrect. In UDC table 04/PP (Produce Bank File), ensure that the Special Handling Code is set to 2 for the Produce Bank Tape - CTX Format (P04572T2). In releases 8.10 and higher, also verify that Produce Bank Tape - PPD Format (P04572T1) is included in this UDC.</p>

<a name="aref_section229"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong> Why does the payment advice PDF for the Create A/P Bank Tape (R04572T2) UBE print in landscape orientation?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong>  The current design of the Create A/P Bank Tape (R04572T2) would not fit all the information and columns with a portrait orientation on letter sized paper. Therefore, this particular payment program is set to default with a landscape orientation. The report's format would need to be customized to print it with portrait orientation.</p>

<a name="aref_section230"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong> Why is the check payment number, retrieved from Work with GL Bank Accounts (P0030G), displayed when writing an EFT payment group?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong>  If the Pre-Note Code has been flagged for the supplier in the Supplier Master (P04012), a physical check is produced in addition to the ACH test file. In this scenario, the system uses both the Next Payment Number (data dictionary item NXTC) from the GL Bank Account, as well as the Next Number for EFT payments. However, even if the Pre-Note Code is not checked, the system still displays the Next Payment Number from the GL Bank Account, but the number is not used or incremented.</p>

<a name="aref_section231"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong> Why is the EFT Bank Tape for CTX formatting missing a '1' in front of the Tax ID?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4: </strong> To fix this error, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Processing Options of the Create A/P Bank Tape (R04572T2).</li>
<li>Populate Processing Option 4: Identification Code Designator with the Tax ID (data dictionary item TAX) followed by '1'.</li>
</ol>

<a name="aref_section232"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> Why are standard checks (R04572) still printing in conjunction with the EFT program (R04572T2) even though the Pre-Note Code is not checked in the Supplier Master (P04012)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> If you do not have a bank account defined for the Supplier in P0030A, then the file created by the EFT CTX format (R04572T2) would be incomplete and your bank would not know where to send the payment. Therefore, the system treats the EFT process as a pre-note and still prints standard checks even if the pre-note code is not checked in the Supplier Master (P04012). If you are experiencing this issue, ensure you have a bank account defined for the supplier.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section233"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> What could cause an EFT program such as R04572T2 or R04572OZ to loop when Pre-Note Code is checked in the Supplier Master (P04012)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong> This issue is most likely caused by an incorrect set up in the processing options of the EFT print program. For all ACH programs, there is Print tab that has a processing option where you should populate the standard check program that should be used if Pre-Note code is checked in the Supplier Master (P04012). The pre-note code in the Supplier Master (P04012) indicates that you are running a TEST ACH/EFT batch and therefore also need the standard checks to print so that you can mail these to your suppliers. The Print Program on the Print tab should point to a standard, non-EFT program, that prints hard copy checks in the case that Pre-Note code is checked If this processing option is set to the same print program that is calling it (e.g. P04572T2 inside the POs of R04572T2), the program calls itself, so that it will run the first time, check the pre-note code, then use the Print Program PO and call itself again and check pre-note code, then use the Print Program PO and call itself again, over and over again in an endless loop until you get the memory violation. Please change this Processing Option to a standard check print such as the P04572.</p>

Why? How do we correct this?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 7:</strong> There is no TC (table Conversion) for the F0401 during the migration process to E1 from World. E1 does not recognize the value of BLANK because it does not exist in E1. You will need to use a utility to update the field in E1 from P to N.</p>

<a name="aref_section237"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong> Can a default server be specified for the file created by the Copy Payment to Diskette (P0457D) if we have more than one server for  JDE?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1: </strong> To have a default server, you have two options to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to the CNC to make the servers involved visible to each other. Then when writing the path name prefix it the desired server name. For example, \\servername\sharedfolder\filename for Windows server or //servername/sharedfolder/filename for Unix server.</li>
<li>The file is created by business function B0400520. The default path is on the server where the business function is running. Add an OCM mapping so as to make B0400520 run on the desired server.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section238"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can the file name (FNAM) displayed in the P0457 grid be changed?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> The File Name can be changed from the processing option of the program creating this record. For example, in R04572A, R04572T2 and under the Tape tab, change the setup for [File Name].</p>

<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> It is currently not possible to have R04572F3, or any other EFT payment format, to call P0457 and P0457D automatically.</p>

<a name="aref_section241"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Copy Payment To Diskette (P0457, P0457D) Troubleshooting Questions</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section242"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong> When running the P0457 Copy Bank Tape, on release 8.12 on an AS400 platform, why does the export .txt file contain garbage characters?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1: </strong> Verify the AS/400 System or User Specific Code Page. These are the commands used to determine the Code Page by System and User on the AS/400:</p>
<ul>
<li>System code page: cmd: WRKSYSVAL QCCSID</li>
<li>User profile can override system value: cmd: DSPUSRPRF &lt;user&gt;</li>
<li>For example: cmd: DSPUSRPRF JDE Page down 3 times Display User Profile - Basic</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this Code Page value to set up the correct Flat File Encoding page in the Work with Flat File Encoding application (P93081). </p>
<div class="kmnotebox">Technical Note: The API used to create the Flat File on P0457 application is creating the flat file in Text Mode. Since the file is already created in text mode; the original code page needs to be used to see the correct information if a windows application like Text Pad is used (Please do not use Notepad).</div>

<a name="aref_section243"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong> On an 8.12 web release and on an AS400 platform, why does the output only go to the IFS file under the Root Directory? </h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong> This functions as designed and unfortunately this cannot be changed at this time. <br /> <br /> As of February 2010, a client provided the following suggestion. "use /folder/folder/filename. For example using "/E900/DV900/Export/ACH.txt" will write the ACH.txt to the Export folder under the DV900 folder under E900."</p>

<a name="aref_section244"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong> When I try to copy the bank file to a flat file, why do I get an error message saying "Error while attempting to create file"?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong>  There are multiple reasons why this error can occur.</p>
<ol>
<li>The actual file will be created by a business function running on the Enterprise Server. Therefore make sure the path is correct considering the Enterprise Server Operating System path rules. Examples:</li>
<ul>
<li>If the Enterprise Server is UNIX based the path must be /FolderName/Filename.</li>
<li>If the Enterprise Server is Windows based the path must follow Windows convention \FolderName\FileName or even \\MachineName\SharedFolderName\FileName.</li>
</ul>
<li>Verify the JD Edwards Service user (the user under which the JD Edwards services are started on the Enterprise Server) has write authority on that path. A simple test would be to log on to the Enterprise Server with the JD Edwards Service user and navigate to that path and try to create a file.</li>
<li>The first screen from where you would select what you want to copy is based on the table F0457 and the detail that you will actually copy is from F04572OW table. Verify the F04572OW data actually exists. </li>
<li>The B0400520 Write String To File, needs to have an active OCM mapping to the same machine that the Default File/Path Name is on</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<a name="aref_section245"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Why do the records in a payments text file not have the desired/needed number of characters?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> The record length of a text file processed through Copy Bank File to Diskette (P0457D) depends on the processing option value for record length behind P0457D. This is the first processing option on tab 'Defaults'.<br /> If this processing option is left blank, the records in the file created will have their original length, which may not be the desired/needed number of characters per record.<br /> To create records with the desired/needed number of characters, populate this processing option with this number.</p>
<hr>

<a name="aref_section246"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5</strong>: Why might the bank file appear as only one line of data when running the P0457D Copy Bank Tape using a non Windows Enterprise Server?</h4>
<p>Answer 5: The data will appear as either one or two lines depending on which program you are using to view the data. For example in notepad the data might appear as one line, but using notepad ++ the data might appear as two lines. This is because some operating systems use different New Line conventions. However, the record has been created successfully may still process through the bank. See more on this in <a href="../docs/1970954.html" target="_blank">When creating a file with P0457D, why is the file missing the carriage returns?</a></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section247"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> What could cause the Create Bank Tape (P0457D) to generate a blank text file?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong> It is possible that the UDC 04/SC is set up incorrectly. Per E1: 04: Overview of User Define Codes Within EnterpriseOne Accounts Payable Setup (P0004A) (Doc ID 1991768.1), this UDC needs to have the invalid characters (up to 30) in the description 01 field and NOT in the code field. They can have up to 30 per line in this UDC and the Code value actually does not matter. Be sure to clear cache after making changes to any UDC.</p>

<a name="aref_section249"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is there a process by which I could use the F0413Z1 and F0414Z1 tables data for inbound payments processing?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> Since Payments are usually meant for outbound processing, it allows to share payment information with the external systems. Currently there is no such process which could use the inbound information in the F0413z1/F0414z1 tables to process it further to create payments in the master transaction F0413 and F0414 tables. However, you can use the R04110ZA to create Manual Payments without Voucher Match. To do so, you add a Matching Document Number (DOCM) to the F0411Z1 data. This process will create the voucher and associated payment in the F0413 and F0414 tables.</p>
