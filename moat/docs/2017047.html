<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding Payee Control (X0450, P0450).</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Does Payee Control create an audit record when deleting a supplier's payee information?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong>  Payee Control functionality has the capability to create an audit trail only for changes and additions of critical banking information. Deleting a record would not result in a fraudulent payment. Therefore, it is not necessary for the purpose of Payee Control (X0450) to create an audit record when deleting a supplier's payee information.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong>  Does Payee Control change a voucher's Pay Status to H (Hold) until its related changes have been approved?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong> Payee Control (X0450) only prevents payments on a voucher through automatic payment processing when unapproved changes exist in the Payee Control (F0450) table. Vouchers are not placed into a Hold Payment Status (data dictionary item PST). </p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong>  How are users given privileges to approve Payee Control records in the Payee Control Approval (P0450) program?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3: </strong> All users have the capability to approve Payee Control records via the Payee Control Approval (P0450) program. To limit the users that are allowed to approve payee control, application security should be configured for the Payee Control (P0450) program.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:  </strong>Is there a report that lists the users who have the ability to approve Payee Control (F0450) records? </h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong>  Because there is no control over the users who have these privileges directly through Payee Control, there is no report that lists assigned approvers.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong>  Are changes to supplier Payment Terms audited through Payee Control?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 5:</strong> The Payment Terms (data dictionary item TRAP) field is not considered critical banking information that could lead to fraudulent payments. Therefore, Payee Control (X0450) does not track changes to this field. </p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong>  Is it possible to create a different version of the AP Payee Control Server Processing Options Only (X0450)?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 6:</strong>  The ZJDE0001 version of the AP Payee Control Server (X0450) is the only version the system can use for Payee Control because it is hard coded within the logic of the Payee Control process. New versions would require customization to be used within EnterpriseOne and therefore this is not recommended. </p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:</strong>  Is it possible to reject pending changes?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 7:</strong>  Undesired changes that are made to vital payment information need to be manually reverted back to the original values through the Supplier Master (P04012), Work with Bank Accounts by Address (P0030A), or Standard Voucher Entry (P0411) applications. The Payee Control Approval program (P0450) provides only the capability to approve records.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong>  Does Payee Control affect Payroll if employees have a corresponding Supplier Master record (F0401)?</h4>
<p class="km">Answer 8:  Payee Control only affects payments made to suppliers through the Accounts Payable system. Therefore, pending changes in the Payee Control Review and Approval (P0450) application would not disrupt any payments made through the Payroll system.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:  </strong>What is the functionality of the reset button in the Payee Control Approval program (P0450)?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 9:</strong>  The Reset option from the Form exit on the Payee Control Details (W0450B) form resets the Approval status of the Payee Control (F0450) record prior to committing the approval by pressing the OK button. If the record is pending approval, the Reset option will change the records approval status back to an unapproved status. It does not have the capability to change the data values back to their previous value.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong>  After changes to a bank account have been approved through Payee Control Approval (P0450), is the Bank Transit Master table (F0030) updated?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 10:</strong>  After changes are approved to a bank account through the Payee Control Approval application (P0450), only the Payee Control table (F0450) is updated. The Bank Transit Master (F0030) is only updated if a user has made a change to the account directly through the Work with Bank Accounts by Address (P0030A) or the Work with G/L Bank Accounts (P0030G).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong>  Why is a copy of the ZJDE0001 version of the AP Payee Control Server (X0450) not recognized by the system?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11:</strong>  The ZJDE0001 version of the AP Payee Control Server (X0450) is the only version the system uses for Payee Control because it is hard coded within the logic of the Payee Control process. New versions, whether copies or not, would require customization to be used within JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and therefore this is not recommended.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12:</strong>  Despite row security on the Address Book Master table (F0101), why do users who do not have the privileges to make changes to Address Book information still cause creation of Payee Control (F0450) records when a change is attempted, but not saved?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12:</strong>  Row security on the Payee Control (F0450) table needs to be configured in conjunction with row security on the Address Book Master (F0101) table to avoid the creation of false Payee Control records.  If you set up Row Security for a specific data item in the Address Book Master F0101, then you must set up Row Security for that same data item in the Payee Control table F0450.<br />If the Row Security does not match (by data dictionary item item), then the system will write a record to F0450.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13:</strong>  Changes to employee records, such as bank account information, fails to utilize Payee Control (X0450).</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 13:</strong>  To take advantage of the Payee Control functionality for employees, each employee needs to have a corresponding Supplier Master record in the Supplier Master (P04012).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 14:</strong> Is there any functionality that suspends the system-wide use of a Supplier's Address Book record until an update is approved?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 14:</strong> The purpose of Payee Control is to prevent fraud in Accounts Payable (i.e. to ensure that the vendor receives the payment and not a fraudulent party). Until a Payee Control record is approved, the system prevents automatic payments to the associated payee by printing an error message on the Create Payment Group report (R04570) and not including the vouchers in the payment group.  The purpose of payee control is not to track all changes and to temporarily suspend the Address Book (AB) record.  If you do not want your users to be able to use an AB after it has been changed and before the changes have been reviewed, consider using the &lsquo;Hold Code&rsquo; in the Supplier Master (F0401) and the Customer Master (F03012). However, this will be a manual process and users will need to be educated that they need to change the Hold Flag manually after updating an AB record.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note: Payee Control is not applicable for Manual Payment Processing.</div>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 15:</strong>  Is Payee Control functionality only applicable for suppliers (Search Type V)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 15:</strong>  The Payee Control functionaity has no relation with the Search Type for an address book records. It will work in synch with the Processing Options setup of X0450 A/P Payee Control Server only. For instance, if A/P Ledger (F0411): Payee is set as "2", whenever the value of Payee changes for an existing F0411 record or a voucher record is added for a payee in F0411, system will create records in P0450 irrespective of the Search Type.</p>
<hr />
<div>
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 16:</strong>  Is there any workflow available which notifies the users of records that require approval?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 16:</strong>  There is no workflow functionality available for the Payee Control functionality at the moment. The authorized users have to review the records manually as desired.  Additionally, they can consider to run Payee Control Approval Report (R04505) on frequent basis which will provide the list of Payee Control Records that need to be approved.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 17:</strong>  What determines if the company (KCO) field is populated in the F0450 (Payee Control) table?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 17:</strong>  The KCO field will only be populated when a change is made to Payee (PYE) field of an existing F0411 (Accounts Payable Ledger) record.</p>
