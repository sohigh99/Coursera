<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document provides answers to frequently asked questions on payment terms and advanced payment terms within the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Financial system.</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Accounts Payable General Questions</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong>What causes the "Split Payment not Allowed" error on a Payment Term in Speed Voucher Entry (P0411SV)?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 1:</strong> This issue is caused by the Number of Split Payments and Days to Pay Aging on the Blank Payment Term setup in P0014. When using this option, the system creates multiple pay items on a voucher to account for the split payment". This occurs on the commit of the voucher. Speed Voucher Entry (P0411SV) was designed to be a simple and quick voucher entry program and does not have the capability to create multiple pay items on a single voucher. Vouchers entered through P0411SV can only be one pay item. Therefore, if using a Payment Term that has defined a Split Payment setup, the system throws the error because the program does not have the capability to create the split payment. This issue is functioning as designed. Consider using one of the following work arounds in this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Standard Voucher Entry (P0411) to enter vouchers with the BLANK payment term because this program has the ability to create vouchers with multiple pay items.</li>
<li>Alter the blank payment term to not use the Split Payment setup.</li>
<li>Adjust the payment term during Speed Voucher Entry (P0411SV) to a payment term that is not using a split option.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong>When the Payment Terms are changed in a voucher, the Due Dates are not recalculated, why?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 2:</strong> If you change the Payment Terms to recalculate the Due Dates (Net Due Date or Discount Due Date), it is necessary to blank out the existing value from the Due Date field.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong>Is it possible to set up discounts in Accounts Payable to be a reduction of the Gross Amount and therefore a reduction in the expense, rather than as Discount Taken revenue?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 3:</strong> Working as designed. It is possible to add extra lines to the G/L Distribution details upon voucher creation, but this would require quite a bit of manual entry including journal entries to balance your accounts</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong>What causes the General Ledger Post (R09801) to trigger an "Out Of Balance" error when a voucher is posted with a split payment term?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 4:</strong> The failure of post on vouchers with split payment terms are caused by soft rounding. To overcome this issue, it is advised to use Speed Status Change (P0411S) to efficiently split the vouchers.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5: </strong>Can the payment term be defined by LOB or Company in Accounts Payable?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 5:</strong> Payment terms are set up at supplier master level.  Since in Accounts Payable, there is no LOB (Line of Business) functionality, it is not possible to set up Payment Terms by company or business unit.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6: </strong>Why are errors triggered when entering a voucher using a Payment Term linked to a work day calendar that has a value in the Shift Code?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 6:</strong> The Shift Code (data dictionary item SHFT) in not used in the Accounts Payable module. Workday calendars for use with the Accounts Payable or Accounts Receivable should only have the following fields populated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branch/Plant (data dictionary item MMCU).</li>
<li>Calendar Year (data dictionary item YR).</li>
<li>Calendar Month (data dictionary item MT).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7: </strong>Is there a way to set up a payment term where the discount will always be taken, regardless of the date the payment is made?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 7:</strong> The discount will always be taken when the net due date and the discount due date are the same.  To do this, you can set up a<span id="form1:panelPage1"> due date rule in P00146 (Work with Due Date Rules).  Then go to P00145 (Work with Advanced Payment Terms) and create a new payment term.  Set the Discount Due Date Rule and Net Due Date Rule as the same due date rule that was created in P00146.  Now all vouchers created using this payment term should have the discount due date equal to the net due date, which should result in the discount always being taken.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Accounts Receivable General Questions</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1: </strong>Is it possible to set up a payment term where a transaction is due upon receipt?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 1:</strong> Setting up payment term without any additional information yields a payment term where the due date is calculated as the receipt date.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">Is there a global update program available to update the Payment Terms on existing, unpaid invoices in the Customer Ledger (F03B11) using the value in the Customer Master (F03012)? </span></h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 2:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">Unfortunately, Speed Status Change (P03B114) is the only way to update the payment terms (PTC) on existing invoices in the Customer Ledger (P03B11). You can use the Global Update option to do more than one invoice at a time. However, there is no batch program that does this for you.</span></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong>Our company sells annual business licenses.  This license must be renewed each year on May 1st at a cost of $2000. How to setup the payment terms so that the first recurring invoice is due when application is submitted for the first time, but each subsequent recurring invoice is due on May 1st of the following year?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 3: </strong>Create a special calendar, having the only working day on the 1st of May. The Branch/Plant you used in the calendar must exist in the Business unit master table (F0006). (Be sure this calendar is defined for all the years) Create a due date rule using this calendar and use this due date rule to create a payment term. Create an invoice with two lines, one with the initial payment and the second one with the license payment. Important: in the first line the due dates (for invoice and discount) has to be overwritten with the invoice date (or with the due date one wants). The GL distribution will have two lines. When one will recycle this invoice, one will get a one-line invoice for the second next year (1st of May calendar has to be set for 2008 also).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Why is the Update AR Invoices (R005142) failing to update all valid invoices for a company that has a multi-tier discount payment term?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 4:</strong> If the Update AR Invoices (R005142) is failing to update any invoice in a company, it may be related to the Company's Tax Rule (P0022). If a Company's Tax Rule (P0022) is set to Calculate Taxes Based on Gross Amount EXCLUDING Discount, then the Update AR Invoices (R005142) is hardcoded to skip any invoices in that company. <span id="form1:panelPage1"> The reason for skipping these invoices is because changing the discount amount would also require a recalculation of taxes. </span>Therefore, if you plan to use multi-tier discounts for a company, ensure that the Tax Rule (P0022) is set up to Calculate Taxes Based on Gross Amount INCLUDING Discount.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> How do installment payment terms show in the customer ledger (P03B2002)?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 5:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">When you have installment payment terms, what the system does is it breaks up your invoice into multiple pay items. So, let's say you enter an invoice with one pay item for 100 dollars and the new payment term. During the save, the system breaks out the 100 pay item to two pay items, one for 90 and the other pay item line for 10. Each will have the 45 and 90 day out due dates, respectively.  When you query on the batch in the Customer Ledger (P03B2002) and without summarize on, the system displays two lines for this invoice.</span></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">How does installments show up in terms of aging on an invoice?</span></h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 6:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">In terms of aging, the system ages each pay item separately. For example, if you run  AR Details with Aging (R03B4201B), the invoice is pulled and displays as two separate lines. Both are the same invoice number, but they have a different Pay Item Number. If you have one of the lines that is still current, it would show its amount in the Current column, while if the other is past due, it would appear in the 1-30 column, and so on. </span></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:  </strong>Is there a way for installment payment terms to create each installment with its own invoice number?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 7: </strong>Installment payment terms splits an invoice into various pay items with different due dates. There is no way to create multiple invoices using a payment term, but you may wish to consider using recurring invoices instead if you are billing customers the same amount on a regular basis. See &lt;KM Note 1466797.1&gt; for more information.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>General Questions<br /> </strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section218"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> How can a payment term be set up that calculates 45 days from the invoice date and lands on the end of the month?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 1:</strong> In payment terms, you can set up Days to Add or Months to Add but there is no functionality to round  to the last day of a month. Advanced payment terms, however, does allow you to set up payment terms by date range, so you could set up a date range for every day of the month. Depending on your business requirements, you may need to set up several payment terms since each month has a different number of days.</p>
<p class="km">There are two possible ways to get the desired result:</p>
<ol>
<li class="km">Set up a due date rule with month to add 1 and fixed days 31. This would be for the first 16 days of the month. Set up another due date rule with month to add 2 and fixed days 31. This would be for 17 up until 31. Set up two advanced payment terms and attach the rules.</li>
<li class="km">On the Due Date Rule, the only field to be populated is the Days to Add = 45. Then a Date Range would have to be setup and attached to the Due Date Rule. It would have to be calculated  out and created for every day of the month. For example: 1 to 1, Days to Add = 30 ...11 to 11, Days to Add = 20...30 to 30, Days to Add = 1 for  the entire month. It would also be specific to each month and you will have to setup a different Date Range for each month as  your days to add will result differently as there are different total days in each month.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section219"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong>How can Payment Terms be set up such that invoices entered prior to the fifth of the month are due 45 days from the fifth and invoices entered after the fifth of the month have a due date 45 days from the fifth of the following month?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong>Setup a Due Date rule with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Days equal to 5.</li>
<li>Attach it a Due Date Range with two ranges: <br />
<ul>
<li>Date Range is 1-5 and with Days to Add 45.</li>
<li>Date Range is 6-31 with Days to Add 45 and Month to Add 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system calculates the date based on the Due Date rule and then it will apply the Due Date Range rules.</p>
<a name="aref_section220"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong>Can a payment term be set up using both a Discount Due Date and a Proxy Date?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 3:</strong> A payment term can only be configured with a Discount Due Date or a Proxy Date. One payment term cannot use both.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section221"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong>Is it possible to set up a payment term that calculates the due date as the 10th of the following month?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 4:</strong> This type of payment term is possible when using the Prox Date Month (data dictionary item PXDM) and Prox Date Day (data dictionary item PXDD) in the Payment Terms Revisions (P0014) program.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section222"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5: </strong>Can the Blank Payment Term be removed from P0014?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 5: </strong>The Blank (default) Payment Term can be removed from P0014. However it is not recommended to remove it if there are Historical records containing this value.E1 Distribution programs might stop working when the BLANK value is deleted from Payment Terms. This occurs because of the DD edit behind PTC against BSFN IsColumnInPymtTermsTable. The Edit is executed in Tools Code beneath the Application layer of code. So in any given program if a variable is declared based on PTC and the variable is not populated, the underlying DD edit may trigger an error.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section223"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> Is it possible to set up a payment term 90 days end of month?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 6:</strong> Using standard payment terms, prox date month 3 and day 31 is a close approximation to 90 days end of month, but does not always provide the correct result. Using advanced payment terms, you can have a Due Date Rule with a Days to Add of 90 and a Range attached with one record for days 1-31.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section224"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7: </strong>What is signified by the value R in the Range or Tier field in Work with Due Date Rules (P00146)?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 7: </strong>The Range or Tier (data dictionary item EV01) field is set to R when a date range is attached to the due date rule.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section225"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8: </strong>Is it possible to set up a payment term that calculates a due date that is 60 days after the 1st of the following month?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 8: </strong>The Advanced Payment Terms (P00145) would need to be used to configure this type of payment term. The Due Date Rule (P00146) used by the advanced payment term should be based on invoice date. When setting up the Due Date Rule in Due Date Rules Revisions (P00146):</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Date Range from the Form exit.</li>
<li>Define a range from 1 to 31.</li>
<li>Populate the Days to Add (data dictionary item DADD) with 60.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong> Answer 9:</strong> Neither Standard Payment Terms (P0014) nor Advanced Payment Terms (P00145) have the capability to calculate due dates based on fiscal quarters.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section227"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong> After creating a new Advanced Payment Term, a new voucher was added but Advanced Payment Terms were not calculated, why?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10:</strong>  After creating a new Advance Payment Term the user must restart E1 (Log out/ Log in) as the table F00144 is part of database cache. Any changes made to F00144 table will be added to the cache only after restarting E1. This cache is used from Tools Release 8.95 onwards.</p>

<a name="aref_section228"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11: </strong>Is it possible to set up a payment term due on a certain day of the week (e.g. Friday)?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 11:</strong> Although there is not a specific option to calculate a due date on a specific day of the week, a workday calendar could be used to define that day of the week to be a working day only. For additional information on the Work with Workday Calendar (P00071), see knowledge <a href='../docs/1411304.html'>How To Set Up Standard and Advanced Payment Terms in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Financial System (P0014, P00145, P00146, R005142, R005141)</a>.</p>

<a name="aref_section229"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12: </strong>How can an advanced Payment Term be configured to use a specific date (e.g. June 1, 2011)?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 12:</strong> To identify a specific date that should be used as a due date in an advanced payment term, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a Business Unit (data dictionary item MCU).</li>
<li>Create a work day calendar for this Business Unit (data dictionary item MCU) in the Work with Workday Calendar (P00071) application for each month. All days in these months should be set to E for weekend, except the fixed date to be used for the due date. This date should be set to a W for work day.</li>
<li>Create a Due Date Rule using the Work with Due Date Rules (P000146) application and associate it with the work day calendar created in step 2.</li>
<li>Create an Advanced Payment Term using the Work with Advanced Payment Terms (P000145) application and associate it with the due date rule created in step 3.</li>
</ol>

<a name="aref_section230"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13: </strong>How does the system determine the due date for tiers when using Multitiered Discounts?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 13:</strong> The discount due date for the first tier is calculated using the information provided in the Due Date Rule. To determine the discount due date for subsequent tiers, the system adds the value in the To field of the tier to the Based on Date (data dictionary item DABS) being used. To calculate new discount percentages and discount due dates for subsequent tiers, the Batch Update for Multitiered A/P (R005141) UBE must be run.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section231"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 14: </strong>Is it possible to create a Payment Term with a Prox Date that exceeds 12 months?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 14:</strong> The Prox Date Month (data dictionary item PXDM) field in the Payment Terms Revisions (P0014) is limited to 12. As a workaround, create an Advanced Payment Term (P00145).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section232"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 15: </strong>Why is a voucher with three installments of equal percentage not dividing into three equal parts?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 15: </strong>The system uses soft rounding when amounts do not divide evenly. A workaround to this would be to use Splits functionality instead of installments. Split functionality is defined in Work with Payment Terms (P0014). When entering vouchers, each split amount is determined by dividing the amount entered by the number of splits.</p>

<a name="aref_section233"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 16:</strong> Using Advanced Payment terms to determine discount and net due dates.  Discount due date is on the 10th of the following month; except if the invoice date is after the 25th of the month, then it will be due on the 10th of the second month following. </h4>
<ul>
<li class="km">For example, Invoices dated 10/1 - 10/24 would have the discount until 11/10; invoices from 10/25 - 10/31 would have the discount available until 12/10.  However, if invoice is between 10/11 and 10/24 the system is calculating a 12/10 due date.</li>
</ul>
<p class="km"><br /> <strong>Answer 16:</strong> Date Rule Revisions-Due Date Rules Revision, P00146/W00146B form's fixed date should be &lt;blank&gt; as this information is already setup on the Due Date Rule Date Range.  This was also populated with a "10" which was causing the system to not use the Adv Pymt Term correctly.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section234"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 17:</strong> Does modifying a supplier payment terms have an impact on outstanding AP vouchers or AR invoices?</h4>
<p><strong> Answer 17:</strong> Changes to a supplier payment terms in the Supplier Master or Customer Master do not impact existing vouchers because the discount amount, due dates and any installments have already been calculated.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section235"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 18:</strong> Can you use the Multi-tiered discount process to create the following payment term?</h4>
<p>4% discount if paid in 15 days, or 2% discount if paid by the 25th of the following month, with net due in 61 days?</p>
<p><br /><strong>Answer 18:</strong> No, the multi-tiered process cannot have different fixed days or months to add per tier level, the Due Date Rule determines this for all tiers. The tier can be set up for the Day Range (From and To) and the Discount Percentage. </p>
