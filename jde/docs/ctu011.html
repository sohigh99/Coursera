<h2><a name="1.4">1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview</a></h2>
<p>PT Matahari is a small consulting firm focusing on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software consulting with 100 employees in various cities in Indonesia. The organization comprises mainly three areas &ndash; management, business analyst, and developers.</p>

<p>This project seeks for the opportunity to improve the software process in developing light ERP software through reviewing existing process models, practices, Software Process Improvement (SPI) frameworks, and building the organization specific SPI model/framework for effective development and maintenance of light ERP software.</p>

<h1><a name="2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process Improvement Background</a></h1>
<p>Process is means to produce a product through the integration of tools, people, and procedure in engineering process.&nbsp; Software process is the set of practices and tasks to build and enhance software, which is the sequenced and organized tasks to be performed by a procedure (Saiedian, 2005). The purpose of process model is to produce quality software timely within its budget. Here reviews the industry accepts software process improvement (SPI) methods, its advantage and disadvantage, and selection of SPI methods for this project.</p>
<h2><a name="2.1"></a>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Process improvement (SPI) Methods</h2>
<p>SPI is essential to improve the quality of software, where the software improvement can be accomplished using SPI methods. SPI is a framework to identify potential problems and inefficiencies in Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC) to implement and to devise possible solutions through proper analysis and improvement of software development process.</p>

<p>Some of well perceived methods are Six Sigma, IDEAL model, Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination (SPICE) model, Capability Maturity Model (CMM), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) model, and lastly Sprint in Agile Software Life Cycle.</p>
<h3><a name="2.1.1"></a>2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDEAL Model</h3>
<p>As a federal funded research and development center, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) develops IDEAL model in1996 for software process improvement, which is named by the initial of five phases - Initiating, Diagnosing, Establishing, Acting, and Learning phases. Figure 1 depicts five phases in detail (McFeeley, 1996).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01101.png" border="0" alt="IDEAL" title="IDEAL" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 1. The IDEAL Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiating phase: as the initial steps, which establish the infrastructure of Software Process Improvement (SPI) including high level SPI plan, its schedule, major functional elements high level SPI plan, its schedule, major functional elements through the management steering group (MSG), software engineering process group (SEPG), and other organizational entity;</li>
<li>Diagnosing phase: this phase links the continuous software process improvement path;</li>
<li>Establishing phase: the management team develops/updates a SPI strategic action plan;</li>
<li>Acting phase: this phase implements the developed improvement and puts into practice in the organization; and</li>
<li>Learning/Leveraging phase: prepare for next diagnosing phase along with tuning opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantage of IDEAL model is various disciplines which suits for long-term improvement strategy. As figure 1 reads this method is a continuous improvement model (Anees, 2017). IDEAL model supplements the process improvement plan in the long run. So this process model will be adapted in implementing a hybrid approach between maturity approach and agile approach for PT Matahari to develop software process improvement plan.</p>
<h3><a name="2.1.2">2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPICE Model</h3>
<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) introduced the working title named SPICE (Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination) or ISO/IEC 15504 in 1993. The SPICE model comprises the process dimension and the capability dimension where the process dimension includes customers-suppliers (CUS), Engineering (ENG), Project (PRO), Supports (SUP), and Organizations (ORG) (HM&amp;S, n.d.). On the other hand, the capability dimension is depicted in figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01102.png" border="0" alt="Capacity Dimension in SPICE" title="SPICE" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 2. The Capacity Dimension in SPICE Model</p>
<p>The advantage of SPICE Model is that the organization can focus on a specific process for the area of development rather than the models works iteratively. SPICE model has enhanced the rigidity of maturity model however the capacity model of this model does not suit for PT Matahari as a small organization where teams are segregated by functions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="2.1.3"></a>2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CMMI Staged Maturity Model</h3>
<p>The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is developed in 1991 by Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) to help the organization improve the process in developing software. This model attempts to integrate the rich asset of capability models based on the notion of process maturity, which evolves to an integrated capability model (CMMI). So CMMI supersedes CMM framework and integrates it with other capacity maturity model to overcome weakness of CMM. Some literature categorizes it into the staged CMMI model and the continuous CMMI model. The latter does not classify the organization per discrete levels, unlike earlier CMM model. Figure 3 depicts the process area defined in the managed level in the staged CMMI model (Sommerville, 2016).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01103.png" border="0" alt="CMMI" title="CMMI" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 3. The CMMI Staged Maturity Model</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the staged CMMI model is that each maturity level has its own goals and practices and assumed all these goals need completing before moving on to next phase. The overcome this advantage, the continuous CMMI model is available. CMMI process model is to be discarded for actual implementation of process model because PT Matahari is too new and small organization to implement this.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="2.1.4"></a>2.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sprint Change Method as Software Process Improvement</h3>
<p>Agile determines documentation does not help to improve the development process supposing that the requirements continuously changing supposing that the process improvement is resulted from work improvement. In this context, the main goal of Agile model is to able you to reach there step by step, or repeating the iterative nature of software development incremental shape as depicted in figure 4.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01104.png" border="0" alt="Sprints in Agile" title="Sprint in Agile" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 4. Sprints in Agile Methods</p>
<p>Supposing that change must be adaptive, Agile methods are the natural choice for change project. Study shows that a CMMI maturity level is significant improvement which takes roughly takes two years where this time frame naturally induces changes including new products, new competitors, and restructuring of organization (Foegen et al., 2009).</p>
<h2><a name="2.2"></a>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agile Approach for Software Process Improvement</h2>
<p>There are two distinctive approaches to meet the goal of software development process improvement. One is the maturity approach, which focuses on process improvement and project management by introducing good software engineering practice to an organization with goals of improving product quality and the predictability of process. Generally, the process maturity approach is based on plan-driven development which increases overhead, as result, activities do not translate into programming activities. Another is the Agile approach, which emphasizes the overhead reduction in software development life cycle (SLDC) with characteristics of rapid delivery of functionality and responsiveness to the change of requirements. Agile approaches focus on the code to develop by minimizing formality and documentation (Sommerville, 2016).</p>

<p>PT Matahari is a small organization in developing a light ERP software where a light ERP has the architecture style is a layered style with its pattern &ndash; Model, View, and Controller (MVC) to develop various features in composite design pattern. Since ERP comprises multiple modules which repeats its pattern, I believe Agile approach for the software process improvement is well suited.</p>

<p>Through Agile approach, PT Matahari can (Foegen et al., 2009),</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and resolve issues as early as possible;</li>
<li>Learn how the process improvements work and how difficulties be tackled;</li>
<li>Adapt to change business needs;</li>
<li>Respond to feedback and lessons learned; and</li>
<li>Adopt the vision and goals from CMMI.</li>
</ul>

<p>The adhesion of a single approach may cause the project failure. It is important to adopt the vision, goals and status quo from maturity approach to produce quality product on time without exceeding budget even the Agile approach is proved to be most cost effective for small project for PT Matahari and IDEAL suits as framework of process improvement. The reason for this argument is that the Agile approach may lack of the improvement in the life cycle independent process improvement which encompasses management (project management, quality management, and risk management), support (documentation, configuration management, quality assurance, and problem resolution), and customer-supplier (customer need management and customer support).</p>


<h1><a name="3"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Software Practices for Process Improvement</h1>
<p><a name="_Toc418686239"></a>Process model is to build quality software reasonably close to on time and without exceeding project&rsquo;s budget. There are various process models to meet this goal. Some literature categorize prescriptive and non-prescriptive, or predictive and adaptive, others categorize it predictive (Waterfall, Waterfall with feedback, Incremental Waterfall, V-model), iterative (Prototypes, Spiral, Unified process, Cleanroom), and rapid application development (Agile, XP, Scrum, Lean, Crystal, Feature Driven Development, Agile Unified Process, Kanban). A certain process model gains popularity over another when it overlays the disadvantage of other process model (Stephens, 2015). Possible diagnostic methodology can follow the problem identification, effective solution identification, implement best solution, and finalize knowledge (implement and communication solution).</p>
<h2><a name="3.1"></a>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Identification</h2>
<p>Functional areas segregate the teams in PT Matahari, which is based on the ERP suites as depicted in figure 5. Each team has five business analyst and ten developers where units includes Material Resource Planning (MRP), Shop Floor, Sales, Procurement, Account Receivable, Account Payable, General Ledger, Human Resource &amp; Payroll, and other minor suites.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01105.png" border="0" alt="Organization" title="Organization" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 5. Current PT Matahari Organization</p>
<p>This organization structure gives room for different approaches in software development process depending on the expertise of software managers. As result, current approaches which do not have common practices agreed upon have issues,</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrations between suites are difficult;</li>
<li>Development is rather ad-hoc basis; and</li>
<li>Hard to maintain.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advancement of IT infrastructure in the region gives the opportunities for PT Matahari to move forward from the traditional software development methodology. Figure 6 depicts the design process model &ndash; waterfall for software develoment lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01106.png" border="0" alt="Waterfall" title="Waterfall" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 6. Waterfall Process Model</p>
<p>In this model, the requirements are precisely known in advance which huge amount of documentation, which will not change much during development.</p>

<p>However, the waterfall process model has some known disadvantages which sometimes affect the project success to meet the budget and time limitation. This rigid process model has disadvantages,</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to change in the steps and requirements;</li>
<li>Lacking of client&rsquo;s involvement; and</li>
<li>Delayed testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="3.2"></a>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective Solution Identification</h2>
<p>The benchmark and reverse engineering approach reveal that current commercial ERP software can be characterized with the Layered Style using Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where package is the combination of features with the composite design pattern. And each features are tightly integrated as depicted in Figure 7.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01107.png" border="0" alt="ERP" title="ERP" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 7. ERP Integration</p>
<p>To implement a light ERP with above software architecture in mind, here review the process models: Reverse Engineering for software reuse, Scrum and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) as agile approaches to overcome the disadvantage described in waterfall process model.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="3.2.1"></a>3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverse Engineering</h3>
<p>Reverse engineering is a procedural effort of understanding, duplicating an existing software Oracle&rsquo;s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne (E1), or components without using diagramming, modeling, or documentation through analysis of existing system (Singhal &amp; Gandhi, 2014). It is hard to build the whole source codes for the enterprise solutions from scratch when time and budget are limited. Hence, reverse engineering is viable option for the project to build a light ERP software which is slimmed down version of E1 based on the expertise of business analysts and developers to build quality software without compromising its functionality. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This approach aims to enhance the proven and existing enterprise solution by simplifying existing package through reverse engineering tool. This tool encompasses software maintenance, re-use, re-engineering, evolution, and testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: easier or minimum documentation, quicker design of system structure, and naturally faster implementation.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: highly depending on the existing system E1 which can be practical limit for evolution because this approach may take disadvantage of current product.</li>

<h3><a name="3.2.2"></a>3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature-Driven Development</h3>
<p>Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is another incremental and iterative development model in Agile approach to accomplish comprehensive software using five phases depicted in (TatvaSoft, 2015). The five phases comprises developing model, building a feature list, planning by feature, designing by feature, and building by feature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01108.png" border="0" alt="Feature Driven Development" title="Feature-Driven Development" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 8. Feature-Driven Development</p>
<p>The reason for choosing this development model is that the ERP software is built based on the collection of comprehensive features to record and manipulate daily transactions without fail even it is a light one. The nature of ERP lies in its composite pattern using composite (can have other object underneath) and leaf (very last object in a tree) which has iterative and incremental nature by itself.</p>
<h3><a name="3.2.3"></a>3.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scrum</h3>
<p>The Scrum development methodology can be applied to almost any project when the requirements changes rapidly (TatvaSoft, 2015). In Scrum, the person who brings the software to life is the product owner who is responsible for the software through its life cycle. This scrum approach deals with vision, value, and validation in the hierarchy which starts from company vision, business strategy, production vision, product strategy, release plan, sprint plan, and daily plan in top down approach.</p>

<p>One of essential component of Scrum is Sprint. The Sprint is a time-box of a month to complete runnable product. Each Sprint can be considered as a small project which is a small program in the ERP suite. In this approach, the Sprint is a kind of the feedback loop to the product owner who creates the program.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01109.png" border="0" alt="Scrum" title="Scrum" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 9. Linear View of Scrum Methodology</p>
<p>Scrum framework depends on pillars &ndash; transparency (regarding visibility), inspection (on Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal), and adaptation reads (including Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective) as the Scrum Guide reads. As depicted in figure 9, basic elements of Scrum approaches are (McGreal &amp; Jocham, 2018),</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrum Role: Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master;</li>
<li>Scrum Artifacts: the Product backlog, the Sprint backlog, and the Increment; and</li>
<li>Scrum Events: the Sprint, the Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.</li>
</ul>
<p>The light ERP software of PT Matahari to develop is a series of iteration. For instance, sales order entry comprises various validation on customer and item. And the validation of item extends to item price, cost and so forth. Hence, this development model suits for building software with huge number of components/iterations.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="3.3"></a>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution Justification</h2>
<p>As reviewed earlier, current development process &ndash; Waterfall development process is not suitable for comprehensive software development. Hence, three development process with focus on software process improvement are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse Engineering: predictive process model spends huge amount of time for the requirements elicitation, analysis and its documentation for both requirements and design. Through reverse engineering approach, which abolishes the requirements by reviewing the existing commercial ERP software Oracle&rsquo;s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne to extract business requirements.</li>
<li>Feature-Driven Development: the origin of this methodology is to deal with bigger team in combining whole software engineers in PT Matahari since ERP is integration of multiple suites with limited time 1.5 ~ 2 years&rsquo; time frame. This incremental and iterative nature improve software process by following five phases described earlier.</li>
<li>Scrum: with minimized documentation and putting more effort on coding itself based on the analysis made through reverse engineering. This approach is essential to shorter sprint to generate usable software in time.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three approaches are essential to build a light ERP software successfully and accomplish the software process improvement.</p>
<h2><a name="3.4"></a>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution Implementation and Communication Plan</h2>
<p>The software process improvement plan is ongoing project by choosing right process models which are most suitable for PT Matahari. IDEAL and three process models for strategic level and tactical level are chosen for the success of project.</p>
<h3><a name="3.4.1"></a>3.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution Implementation</h3>
<p>The organization need evolving as depicted in figure 10 which is evolved form based on figure 5.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01110.png" border="0" alt="Organization for SPI" title="Organization for SPI" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 10. Revised Organization for SPI</p>
<p>In this figure, the practice suggested by IDEAL model got applied to accomplish the software process improvement which is align with software development models in building a light ERP software for PT Matahari. In this steps, PT Matahari builds the infrastructure for successful software process improvement as below (Layman, 2005),</p>
<ul>
<li>Executive Leadership Group (ELG) &amp; Management Steering Group (MSG): Since PT Matahari is a small organization which combines ELG and MSG for sponsoring SPI plan including approval, budgeting. This team is accountable for the success of SPI.</li>
<li>Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG): comprises senior software engineers, analyst, architects, and developers to decide on development approaches.</li>
<li>Process Action Teams (PATs): this team undertakes some process development or improvement task based on hands-on development experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="3.4.2"></a>3.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication Plan</h3>
<p>The purpose of communication plan is to make sure that ongoing software process improvement plan is relevant, accurate, and consistent to project stakeholders and other audiences to gain support and cooperation from each stakeholders as well.</p>

<p>Commonly, the development of communication action plan comprises the processes as depicted in figure 11 (MITRE, n.d.).</p>

<h1><a name="4"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metrics and Measurement Process Improvement</h1>
<p>The assumption made so far is that a good software process results in a high quality software, nearly on time without exceeding its budet based on SPI enviornment in figure 12.</p>

<h2><a name="4.1"></a>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPI Initiatives</h2>
<p>The SPI initiatives comprises frameworks, practices, and its tools used. Frameworks help the organization to prioritize its improvement and to focus on the area where more attention is needed. Practices are performed and planned software engineering practices during software development lifecycle (SDLC). And tools help Software Process Improvement (SPI) project to utilize requirements management, scripting for automation, and configuration management (Islam&amp; Unterkalmsteiner, 2009). This posting reviews the methodology for metrics, metrics to use, challenge of selected methodology, and its solution.</p>

<p>Figure 13. Corporate Goal and Project Goal</p>
<h2><a name="4.2"></a>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metrics</h2>
<p>The metrics, the quantitative measurement of software quality, determine the quality of software, which can be categorized into size, productivity, rework, effort, schedule, and quality, which are highly dependent on the capability maturity level of the development process during the software development lifecycle (McAuley, 1993). There are various measurement frameworks available where a measurement frameworks is a set of related metrics including data collection mechanism, and data uses in software (Mendonca et al., 1998).</p>

<p>The development project of light ERP software project is to establish a baseline for the measurement of SPI for PT Matahari. Hence these metrics are to be analysed and assessed throughout software development lifecycle.</p>
<h2><a name="4.3"></a>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measurements Plan</h2>
<p>This section reviews overall measurement plan encompassing how to collect it and who does the collecting it, how to analyse and evaluate it by reviewing the metrics chosen above. Table 6 entails the definition of metrics and its measurement.</p>

<p><em>Note: Cost Metrics and Schedule Metrics are combined here because these factors are tightly related and intertwined. </em></p>

<p>Table 7 gives the detail view of the source of data collection and collector for chosen metrics. The main concern of light ERP software development is budget and time factor by putting the focal point to the features in the system. It can be good approach to assess the improvement through benchmark based on similar software development project when applicable.</p>

<p>Analyzing the collected measurement data is essential to generate the indicators for improvement. In other words, indicators are derived from the performed analysis on measurement data. Commonly, both objective and subjective data analysis help management to analyze the improvement. The objective data comprises staff hours, SLOC, function points, components, test items, units codes, changes, or defects. And the subject data encompasses level of problem difficulty, degree of new technology involved, stability of requirements (Acqnotes, 2013).</p>

<p>The evaluation of the effectiveness of the measurement is important through examining the correlation between the goal attainment and measurement results as depicted in figure 14. In this figure, both database in core measurement process and experience data describe how the iteration of plan, perform and evaluation works (Islam &amp; Unterkalmsteiner, 2009).</p>

<p>Figure 14. Evaluation in Measurement Process</p>
<h2><a name="4.4"></a>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Collection Approach - The Goal/Question/Metric Method (GQM)</h2>

<p>The GQM methodology or Goal-Question-Measure approach which is built on Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP) aims to supply information required for changing, guiding, and understanding the software process of a software development project in the organization. This methodology represents both a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach. The former is to define and collect measurement, and the latter is to analyze the data collected against stated measurement goals. GQM integrates the goal of organization into measurement goals and entails measurable attribute on step-by-step basis. Hence, GQM contributes to identify the exact metrics needed based on measurement goal, not the software best practice (Komi-Sirvio, 2004). In this context, software measurement compasses the quality of software as a product (product measures), process performed (process measures), and resources used (resource measures). Figure 15 depicts a brief overview using size metrics and quality metrics in building a light ERP software for PT Matahari for the first time.</p>

<h2><a name="4.5"></a>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challenges in measurement data collection and evaluation</h2>

<p>The complexity and uncertainty of implementing metrics program makes whole SPI project skeptical. Especially, it is hard for PT Matahari to choose right measurements since this organization does not have sufficient software development experience. As table 8 represents, challenges vary depending on metrics patterns including measurement itself, people, program, and its implementation (Iversena &amp; Kautzb, n.d.). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="4.6"></a>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution to tackle challenges</h2>

<p>Five factors in SPI project need considerting to to overcome the hinderance in the measurement of SPI inititiave (Iversena &amp; Kautzb, n.d.). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge: The improvement knowledge has to be aligned with organization knowledge to make the goal realistic and visible;</li>
<li>Organization: project organization;</li>
<li>Design: Start from dettermining a simple goal;</li>
<li>Communication: Share objectives and collected data; and</li>
<li>Usage: use the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The software development process gets more disciplined, motivated by the notion that the quality of software is affected by the quality of the process where the process is defined, agreed, followed, and enforced. Assessing the SPI outcomes is as important as the implementation of SPI because the gain of its initiative can be measured only through this activities. SPI improvement project is a new paradigm for PT Matahari who acquires industry best practices to fulfil SPI initiatives.</p>


<h1><a name="5"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Quality Assurance Process Improvement</h1>
<p>This section reviews how Software Quality Assurance (SQA) process positively affects the improvement of software development process, which resulted in the quality software. This section covers what is SQA process, relationship with process improvement, and its implementation. High level SQA can be represented in figure 16, which justifies how SQA can contribute to the improvement of software development process.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01116.png" border="0" alt="SQA" title="SQA" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 16. SQA &amp; Process Improvement</p>
<p>Below reviews how SQA helps PT Matahari build quality software by complying some SQA process model available.</p>
<h2><a name="5.1"></a>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Quality Assurance Process</h2>

<p>Figure 17 depicts a simple view of the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) process using input-process-output (IPO) diagram. This model comprises eight sub-processes comprising: 1. Review project level plans; 2. Develop Quality Assurance (QA) plan; 3. Coordinate its metrics; 4. Coordinate risk program; 5. Perform audits; 6. Coordinate review meetings; 7. Facilitate process improvement; and 8. Monitor test program (Drabick, 2000).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01117.png" border="0" alt="SQL Input-process-Output" title="SQA Input-process-Output" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 17. SQA Input-Process-Output Diagram</p>
<p>SQA assures that the function of software quality including the standards, processes, and procedures are appropriate for the project and are implemented correctly. Here reviews the requirements development, product integration, and validation in detail where CMMI identifies the process improvement processes with requirements development, requirements management, technical solution, product integration, verification, and validation (Fleming, n.d.).</p>
<h3><a name="5.1.1"></a>5.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQA in Requirements Development Process</h3>

<p>Any software development process starts from requirements elicitation, which encompass customer requirements, product requirements, and product-component requirements. SQA plays important role to determine the compliance of documented standards, processes, and procedures. In building a light ERP software for PT Matahari, the design methodologies - reverse engineering, feature-driven development, and Scrum is used. In this process, the elicitation and analysis of requirements are based on existing commercial software, Oracle&rsquo;s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne (E1). In the phases of requirements during SDLC, the business analysts review the functionality of exiting software and suggest the features may not be useful for small and medium sized enterprises.</p>
<h3><a name="5.1.2"></a>5.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQA in Product Integration Process</h3>

<p>The goal of ERP implementation is for integration, which integrates the components to the higher program, in the suites, or between suites. The transactional data of supply and demand resulted in Material Resource Planning (MRP) and sales order updates account receivable for instance. Hence, the integration is one of core process in developing ERP software and integral part of integration is bigger than sum of individual applications. In product integration of SQA ensures that the product/package, as integrated functions correctly. Also, SQA makes sure that documented standards, processes, and procedures are followed. Nonetheless, it is equally important the role of Software Quality Control (SQC) to perform the System Integration Test.</p>
<h3><a name="5.1.3"></a>5.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQA in Verification and Validation</h3>

<p>Validation is the process to check you have built a right product and verification is to determine the product built is right. Both processes are more relevant to SQC realm, but this process is equally important in building the enterprise solutions. Because the enterprise solution comprise huge number of programs towards suites, hence the important of verification and validation are paramount.</p>

<p>V-model represents clear semantics even when V-model is not the choice of design methodology in developing a light ERP. As depicted in figure 18, the top represents validation where below validation processes show verification (Mehle, 2017).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01118.png" border="0" alt="V-Model for Validation and Verification" title="V-Model for Validation and Verification" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 18. V-Model for Validation and Verification</p>
<p>In verification process, SQA plays an important role to check SQC has documented plan, procedures including to determine the effectiveness of verification process. In validation process, even it is very much SQC domain, SQA validates whether the test and feedback conforms the documented procedure and process. These processes highly impacts the continuous improvement and measurement.</p>
<h2><a name="5.2"></a>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process Improvement Identification through SQA</h2>

<p>The change of development processes results in some deficiencies which is the exposure of unfavourable outcome. This section reviews deficiencies and its counter measure to accomplish process improvement (Shang &amp; Seddon, 2007). Since the project for software development is a light ERP, table 9 represents sources of deficiencies and its counter measure using SQA model.</p>

<h2><a name="5.4"></a>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justification</h2>

<p>Above section has listed a number of software development processes during SDLC where the focal point of SQA include the requirements development process, product integration, and verification/validation. In building a light ERP software for PT Matahari, the focus has to be made in both functional requirements and non-functional requirement encompassing functionality, usability, reliability, performance, and supportability (Fleming, n.d.).</p>

<p>Here reviews the potential benefits of each processes in relation with SQA &ndash; Requirements development, product integration, and verification/validation in the context of capacity maturity.</p>

<ul>
<li>Requirements Development: auditing on the requirements based on the exiting ERP software on non-functional requirements can generate the conformance of the documented standards, processes, and procedures. This process is directly linked to the verification process. This process is extremely important PT Matahari in slimming down commercial package JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.</li>
<li>Product Integration: Since the primary purpose of a light ERP software is integration, collaboration, planning, and The SQA process for product integration plays crucial role in the process improvement. In any enterprise solution, the assembly or package of multiple suites determine the success of project. Through sub-processes reviewed in SQM implementation section resulted in successful a light ERP software development project.</li>
<li>Software Verification and Validation: This process determines the conformance of software whether a right software is building and the built software is right. This process enables useful feedback loop with users and conform the quality aspects of software.</li>
</ul>

<p>As reviewed in this section, the Software Quality Assurance plays important role for the software development process improvement in building quality software.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1><a name="6"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk Management Process Improvements</h1>
<p>Risk is the potential harm arises from current process or future event. Risk affects software quality assurance activities which assumed quality software is the result of software process improvement. Hence, proper risk management for PT Matahari is essential for SPI improvement since it is correlated with software quality to build. Figure 19 depicts the information and communication flows in risk management process (NIST, 2012).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01119.png" border="0" alt="Risk Management Process" title="Risk Management Process" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 19. Risk Management Process</p>
<p>The first component of risk management addresses how to frame risk context to establish risk management strategy. The second component, risk assessment addresses how to assess risk based on the risk management strategy established. Based on the assessed risk, the third component determines how to respond to risk including alternative course of action; then the last component determines how the organization monitor risk over time.</p>
<h2><a name="6.1"></a>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk Assessment</h2>

<p>This section discusses the importance of risk management and the key factors in risk assessment process. The success of a software development heavily depends on the amount of risk which corresponds to software development processes. Hence, it is paramount to identify, assess, prioritize, and manage the risk including understanding, mitigation plan because any risk may threaten the success of whole project itself. The benefit of using risk management in software development process are (Iversen et al., 2004),</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on aspects of a problematic situation;</li>
<li>Emphasize potential cause of failure;</li>
<li>Build relationship between potential threats and possible actions; and</li>
<li>Share the lesson learned with team</li>
</ul>

<p>There are various risk factors: structure of the organization, stability of requirements, socio-cultural factors, similar organizational structure, security and privacy, quality management, project size, project management, negative impact on employer's moral, modularity, knowledge management, juridical framework, interfaces in the project management, hidden costs, fluctuation, experience in the domain, experience in offshoring/competences, dependency of the internal knowledge, and architecture. This section reviews factors in a risk assessment in the context of maturity in software process improvement (Zubrow et al., 1994).</p>

<p>So far, risk in processes are identified for PT Matahari. It is time to implement its mitigation plan based the risk assessment made to improve software process. Figure 20 depicts risk mitigation planning in overall risk management process (AcqNotes, n.d.).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ctu01120.png" border="0" alt="Risk Mitigation" title="Risk Mitigation" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p>
<p>Figure 20. Risk Mitigation</p>
<p>Throughout the software development project, it is vital to make sure the effective communication among all stakeholders, managers, developers, and Quality Assurance team. Sharing information and getting feedback on risk will greatly increase the probability of project success. Risk management is extensive discipline, which can mitigated through,</p>
<ul>
<li>Be proactive about risk management</li>
<li>Use checklists, and assess based on baseline accumulated</li>
<li>Prioritize risks based on the severity of exposure</li>
<li>Frequent feedback with stakeholders</li>
<li>Decompose large risk into smaller, if any,</li>
<li>And proper communication on current and future risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assumption was made that the software must be tested in each iteration of development phases for the quality assurance and potential risk in the developed software. The main purpose of this activity is to verify whether the requirements met and prevent/remove possible defects in it. This activity should be more or less same whether it complies with the traditional waterfall model or the agile methodology.
