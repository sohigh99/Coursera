<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Base Pricing defines a pricing basis for items. Base Pricing allows users to create specific prices for designated item and customer relationships. Once the basis is set up, pricing can be supplemented with Standard Pricing or Advanced Pricing to provide additional functionality for discounts, rebates, free goods, repricing, etc. <br /><br />Prices can be retained at one of three levels: the Item level, Item/Branch level or Item/Branch/Location level. The Sales Price Level (PLEV) field in the Item Master (P4101) determines this.</p>

<p>Base Pricing defines a pricing basis for items. Base Pricing allows users to create specific prices for designated item and customer relationships. Once the basis is set up, pricing can be supplemented with Standard Pricing or Advanced Pricing to provide additional functionality for discounts, rebates, free goods, repricing, etc. <br /><br />Prices can be retained at one of three levels: the Item level, Item/Branch level or Item/Branch/Location level. The Sales Price Level (PLEV) field in the Item Master (P4101) determines this.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51001.png" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />The pricing level is reflected in Base Price Revisions (P4106). The keys to the Base Price Revisions (F4106) table are Currency (if applicable), UOM and the Expiration Date. The Credit Price field in the Base Price Revisions (P4106) allows for a different price on returned items.<br /><br />The prices are retained in the F4106 Item Base Price file.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51002.png" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />The date that defaults in for the Effective Date From (EFTJ) is today&rsquo;s date.<br /><br />The date that defaults in for the Effective Date Thru (EXDJ) (on the P4106 and in many other programs) is controlled by the "CENTCHG" and "CTRY" Data Dictionary items. <br /><br />The glossary for "CENTCHG" states: "A value that specifies the default year in which the century changes. The system uses this default value to determine the century when converting dates to Julian format. The default value for the Effective Through Date field is the last day of the year that you enter in this data item."<br /><br />The glossary for "CTRY" states: "The calendar century associated with the year. Enter is the first two digits of the year. For example, 19 indicates any year beginning with 19 (1998, 1999), 20 indicates any year beginning with 20 (2000, 2001), and so on.&rdquo;"<br /><br />So, the CTRY holds the century XX-- and the CENTCHG holds the year --YY.<br /><br />For example if CTRY is set as 20, and CENTCHG is set as 25, the expiration date will default in as 31/12/2025. The 31/12 (last day of the year) is hard-coded.<br /><br />These dates can be manually changed.<br /><em><br />Note: If the dates do not default as per the DD setup, check the F4106 table for corrupted records that have no item number, no customer group and no item group defined (ITM=0, IGID = 0 and CGID = 0). The incorrect dates may default in based on this kind of corrupted record, when clicking the Add button without specifying Item Number.</em></p>

<a name="aref_section32"></a><h3 class="km"><strong><a name="Groups"></a>Item Groups</strong></h3>
<p>Items can be added as either a simple or a complex group. <br /><br />To create a simple item group, add the group name in the 40/PI (Item Price Groups) UDC table.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51003.png" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />Attach the Item Price Group to the Item Master (P4101)<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51004.png" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />And to the Item Branch/Plant (P41026) records. <br /><br /><img src="../images/p51005.png" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />Complex groups allow users to make additional distinctions between the customers or items that are in the group.<br /><br />A complex item price group contains the same information as a simple item price group, except that subgroups can be set within a complex group based on category codes, in order  to charge a different price. Using these category codes, different prices can be set in Base Price Revisions (P4106) program.<br /><br />To set up an item price complex group, add the group name in the 40/PI UDC table.<br /><br />Go to Item Price Group Definition (P4092) within menu G4222 and define the Category Codes for the group. Up to four Category Codes can be used.<br /><br />These must be numbered sequentially, however this does not provide a hierarchy. The numbering is the order in which the category codes will be viewed in the Base Price Revisions (P4106) program. Be certain to accept the definition by using the Accept form exit.<br /><br /><em>Note: Starting 8.9 release, the number of Category Codes that can be used in order to define item and customer group has been changed from four to ten.<br /><br />Note: In EnterpriseOne Base Pricing, an item can belong to only one item price group.</em><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51006.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51007.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />After adding the item group, Generate Item Price Groups (R40931) UBE off menu G4222 can be run, but it is not mandatory. The Item Price Group can be used even without running this report. This UBE creates the Item/Customer Group Relationship (F4093) table. This table contains the allowable combinations for Item Groups and Category Codes that can be used for pricing.<br />Once this UBE has been run, this table can be accessed as a Get Item Group form exit from the Base Price Revisions (P4106) application. The information displayed shows all the Category Codes selected for the Item Group and all the valid values for the Category Codes.<br /><br />After creating the complex group, attach it to the Item Master (P4101) and Item Branch (P41026) by populating the Item Price Group field.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51008.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />Add the category codes to the appropriate UDC tables and attach the category code to the Item Master (P4101) and to the Item Branch/Plant (P41026).

<hr />
<a name="aref_section33"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Customer Groups</strong></h3>
<p>Customer Groups can also be set up as a simple group or as a complex group. <br /><br />To set up a simple customer group, add the customer group name in the 40/PC UDC table. Attach the group name to the Customer Billing Instructions (P03013) in the Customer Price Group field.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51012.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51013.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />A complex customer price group contains the same information as a simple customer price group, except that subgroups can be set within the complex group based on category codes, in order  to charge a different price.<br /><br />To set up a complex Customer Price Group, add the group name in the 40/PC UDC table.    <br /><br />Go to Customer Price Group Definition (P4092 &ndash; version ZJDE0002) within menu G4222 and define the Category Codes for the group. Up to four Category Codes can be used.<br /><br />These must be numbered sequentially, however this does not provide a hierarchy. The numbering is the order in which the category codes will be viewed in the Base Price Revisions (P4106) program. Be certain to accept the definition by using the Accept form exit.<br /><br />If "Date Effective Cat codes" in A/R enhanced constant Turn-on, ensure customer category code is populated in table F03012A. Otherwise, pricing with Complex Customer Group set up do not work.<br />(Refer to "<a href="../docs/625713.html" target="_blank">Date Sensitive Customer Master Category Codes </a>").<br /><br /><em>Note: Starting 8.9 release, the number of Category Codes that can be used in order to define item and customer group has been changed from four to ten.<br /><br />Note: In EnterpriseOne Base Pricing, a customer can belong to only one customer price group.</em><br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51014.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51015.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />After adding the customer group, Generate Customer Price Groups (R40932) off menu G4222 can be run, but it is not mandatory.

<hr />
<a name="aref_section34"></a><h3 class="km"><strong><a name="Hierarchy"></a>Preference Hierarchy</strong></h3>
<p>Defining the Preference Hierarchy (P40073) is another step, which is necessary to ensure that the correct price is obtained. The system uses the hierarchy to determine the order in which it searches for Base Price (F4106) records. <br /><br />It is possible to enter up to 14 numbers in the preference hierarchy; however it is recommended that the number of options is limited to three or four. Each number represents a search by the system through the Base Price (F4106) file. Therefore, each number that is added will increase processing time. <br /> <br /><img src="../images/p51018.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51019.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />How the Pricing Hierarchy is defined will determine which choices are available in the Base Price Revisions (P4106) program. Go into the Base Price Revisions (P4106) program and click Add. <br /><br />Based on the hierarchy above, the following options will be displayed:<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51020.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />Select one of the options and add the appropriate Item or Item Group and Customer or Customer Group information.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51021.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />In case of defining prices based on simple or complex groups, the information is still recorded in the F4106 table and it can be found based on &ldquo;Item Group Key ID&rdquo; &ndash; IGID or &ldquo;Customer Group Key ID&rdquo; &ndash; CGID fields.<br /><br />The Item Group Key ID can be looked up in file Item Key ID Master table (F40941), under the last column, IGID.<br /><br />The Customer Group Key ID can be looked up in the Customer Key ID Master table (F40942), under the last column, CGID.</p>

<a name="aref_section35"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Example</strong></h3>
<p>When entering a Sales Order for a customer that is part of the CCG group and an item that is part of the COMPLEX group, and their category codes match the ones set in the P4106 program, the Unit Price of 23 will default into the detail line:<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51022.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />If entering a Sales Order for the same ITEM, but the customer is not part of the CCG group, or is part of the group, but the category codes do not match the ones from the F4106 record, the generic price set for that item and All customers will be defaulted:<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51023.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/></p>

<a name="aref_section36"></a><h3 class="km"><strong><a name="Updating"></a>Updating Prices</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section37"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Updating/Creating F4106 Records</strong></h4>
<p>Two programs can update an existing F4106 record and these are Base Price Revisions (P4106) and Base/Price Maintenance - Batch (R41830). Base Price Revisions (P4106) updates base prices individually, Base/Price Maintenance - Batch (R41830) can update multiple prices at one time.<br /><br />Four programs can insert a new F4106 record and these are Base Price Revisions (P4106), Base/Price Maintenance - Batch (R41830), Inventory Transfers (P4113) and Inventory Adjustments (P4114). <br /><br />The only other way these fields can be updated is with a SQL Update or Insert Statement or a Custom UBE. If P4106, P4113, P4114 or R41830 are responsible for updating the F4106 record, there will be a PID stamp on the table in UTB. SQL and Custom programs may leave the PID field blank. <em>Note: During the Inventory Transfer, the record gets copied from the From Branch/Plant to the To Branch/Plant in F4106 table. EP4106 is the program that writes the Base Price of the item in F4106 Table. Hence, the PID field will be populated with EP4106 instead of EP4113. This is also valid for F4106 records created through Inventory Adjustments.</em><br /><br /><strong>P4106</strong> Base Price Revisions is an interactive base price maintenance program that requires manual data entry by a user.<br /><br /><strong>R41830</strong> Base/Price Maintenance - Batch is the only program, other than P4106, that will update existing F4106 records to change the existing prices or create new F4106 records for future prices. <br /><br />The batch either overrides the existing price with a new price that is specified or calculates an adjustment to the existing price, depending on how the processing options are set. The adjustment can be an addition, a subtraction, a percentage adjustment, or an override amount.<br /><br />In order to create multiple base prices that can be used on a future date, the Effective From and Thru dates must be specified in the Processing Options of R41830. The program will write new price records to the F4106 table that are based on these dates. If no dates are specified, the report ends without creating the new prices.<br /><br />The system creates future prices based on the existing price with the greatest expiration date.<br /><br /><em>Note: The report does not update the dates for existing F4106 records. Enhancement Bug 10990025 was entered requesting this functionality.</em><br /><br /><strong>P4113</strong> is an interactive program for Inventory Transfers. When performing an inventory transfer FROM a location that has a price TO a location that does not have a base price record in the F4106, a F4106 record is created in the TO location. Similarly, when transferring FROM a Branch/Plant with a F4106 record TO a Branch/Plant with no F4106 record, a F4106 record is created in the TO Branch/Plant.<br /><br /><strong>P4114</strong> is an interactive program for Inventory Adjustments. When performing an inventory adjustment for an item into a new location/lot that gets created on the fly, a new F4106 gets created for this new location/lot if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sales Price Level for the item is set to &ldquo;3&rdquo; - Item/Branch/Location/Lot</li>
<li>There is a record in F4106 for the item and primary location (this price amount gets copied to the new location/lot record)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Currently, there is no interoperability program to import Base Price in F4106 table. Enhancement Bugs 11035361 : &ldquo;P4106 Mass Upload&rdquo; and 10750961 : &ldquo;Base Price Interoperability&rdquo;.</em></p>
<a name="aref_section38"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Updating Prices for a Customer</strong></h4>
<p>The Update Sales Price/Cost (R42950) program is used to update open orders with the cost, price and exchange rate that are current at the moment the program is run. Data Selection can be used to restrict the update process to a selected number of Sales Order Detail (F4211) records.<br /><br />Based on the processing options of the Sales Order Batch Price/Cost Update program, you can define which date the system uses to determine whether it should recalculate costs or prices. For example, base the recalculations on the promised date. Sales order prices can be updated more than once.<br /><br />After running the Sales Order Batch Price/Cost Update program, the system updates the order detail information for open sales orders. The system can either replace the current price in the order detail line with the new price or add a non-stock line for the difference between the current price and the new price. The non-stock line type has to be specified in the processing options for the system to add an additional line. If no line type is specified, the system overrides the original price with the new price.<br /><br /><em>If the Price Override Code field (PROV) in F4211 is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; for certain order lines, the R42950 will NOT change or override their price.  </em></p>
<p><em>Data selection based on Item Key ID Master table (F40941) Item Price Group (PRGR) will only impact the R41830 for items which had their base price created based on Item Group. If the base price was created for the Item Only, this data selection will not impact the R41830, even if these items have an Item Price Group defined in the Item Master (P4101) or Item Branch (P41026).</em></p>

<a name="aref_section39"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Prices in Sales</strong></h3>
<p><a name="Date"></a>When entering a Sales Order in P4210 program, the date that is used to retrieve a Base Price is determined by the Price Effective Date (PEFJ) field. This field is updated by the system as per the Sales Price Based On Date setting in the System Constants (under Branch Plant Constants - P41001).<br /><br /><em>Note: When the price is manually entered at the time of Sales Order Entry, the system will ignore the Price Effective Date field, as the manually entered value overrides the price that is set up in the Base Price Revisions program.</em></p>

<p><br /><em>Note: The Sales Price Based On Date can be changed in the branch plant constants with no repercussions. It only impacts the way the price is retrieved at the time of sales order entry. It will not change the price on existing sales orders. When changing this value on a FAT client the users will have to change each FAT client and sign off and then back on again. On a client server, it will have to be changed on the server and then users need to sign off and back on again once the change has occurred.  </em><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51027.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />Multiple prices for the same item can entered with different effective dates; if for instance, a discount price is offered for a limited period of time.<br /><br />When setting up date ranges that overlap, the system will pick the record from F4106 with the earliest expiration date (Effective Date Thru), as the records are sorted ascending after the expired date in F4106 file.<br /><br /><em>Example:</em><br /> Set up two prices for an item:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">One price with effective dates of 2/1/2011 to 3/31/2011 for 100$;<br />The second with effective dates of 2/15/2011 to 2/28/2011 for 50$;</div>
<p>The unit price of 50$ gets populated on the sales order line, determined by the Price Effective Date (PEFJ) field of 2/25/2011, corresponding to the closest expire date for price setup 2/15/2011 to 2/28/2011.</p>

<p><br />Sales Price Retrieval UOM (set in the System Constants accessed through the Form exit of Branch/Plant Constants - P41001) specifies the unit of measure that the system uses for retrieving base prices for sales order processing. The system enables you to define base prices in the F4106 table in various units of measure.<br /><br />At the time of Sales Order Entry, the system retrieves the Unit Price based on the Sales Price Retrieval UOM and calculates the Extended Price based on the Transaction UOM (UOM) field. If the Transaction UOM is different than the value of Sales Price Retrieval UOM, the system will calculate the Extended Price using the Item UOM Conversions (P41002).<br /><br />The Transaction UOM is determined by the Processing Options of P4210 program. You can override it or set the system to use Primary UOM or Pricing UOM, set on the Weights and Measures tab of Item Master (P4101).<br /><br />The Pricing UOM is defaulting in from the Pricing UOM set on the Weights and Measures tab of Item Master (P4101).<br /><br /><em>Note: As per Bug 11045200, the system will use the Sales Price Retrieval UOM from the system constants to fetch the Price from F4106. If the base price or price adjustments are not found in the specified unit of measure, then the system uses the primary unit of measure for the item. If the price is not defined in these two UOMs, then the system will generate a warning message &ldquo;No Base Price in Effect&rdquo;.</em><br /><br /><img src="../images/p51027.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><em><br />Note: The Pricing Unit of Measure preference allows a pricing unit of measure that is different from the pricing unit of measure set up for the item to default into the pricing unit of measure field in the sales order detail record.</em></p>
<a name="aref_section311"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="Zero"></a>Zero Price</strong></h4>
<p>The system allows you to change the price of a detail line to zero by taking the Zero Price Row exit.<br /><br />The zero price feature can be used to ship product samples to potential customers, to send a replacement part at no cost to the customer, or to ship an item to suppliers for quoting.<br /><br />Creating sales orders with zero price and cost enables the relief and track of the inventory without creating amounts in accounts receivable.</p>
<a name="aref_section312"></a><h4 class="km"><strong><a name="PROV"></a>Price Override Code (PROV)</strong></h4>
<p>Price Override Code (PROV) field in Sales Order Detail (F4211) file specifies if the price on the detail line was overridden or not.<br /><br />The Price Override Code (PROV) field gets flagged with a '1' when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The price is manually overridden at sales order entry or after re-inquiring on the order (or the Zero Price Row exit option was used).</li>
<li>The Sales Order is copied from another order.</li>
<li>The Sales Order was created from Credit Orders from History.</li>
<li>The Sales Order is generated from a Blanket or Quote Order.</li>
<li>When an RMA is created with a disposition that states to create a zero dollar sales order (ie. sending out a replacement).</li>
</ul>

<a name="aref_section313"></a><h3 class="km"><strong><a name="Currency"></a>Prices in Multi-Currency</strong></h3>
<p>If a multi-currency environment is used, the Base Price (F4106) record will have to have a match for not only the unit of measure but also the base company currency. If there is no Base Price record for the transaction currency, the system will retrieve the base currency price and convert it to the transaction currency. In order to avoid conversion rounding issues, it is recommended that base price records be present in both currencies.<br /><br />Prices can be added for items in the domestic currency and as many other currencies as necessary. Currency code and unit of measure are both keys to the F4106 table. <br />If using multicurrency, the system searches for a price in this sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer's currency and the user-specified unit of measure.</li>
<li>Customer's currency and the item's primary unit of measure.</li>
<li>Domestic currency and the user-specified unit of measure.</li>
<li>Domestic currency and the item's primary unit of measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the system does not find a match, it moves to the next level in the pricing hierarchy structure and searches in the same sequence.</p>
<a name="aref_section314"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Generate Base Price/Currency (R410601)</strong></h4>
<p>Multiple new base prices can be added in F4106 file in a different currency by running the Generate Base Price/Currency program (R410601) from G4222 menu. This program generates new base prices based on existing records.<br /><br />When running the Generate Base Price/Currency program, the processing options can be used in order to control the currency and exchange rate in which the new base prices are created.<br /><br /><img src="../images/p51028.png"" border="1" hspace="0"/><br /><br />The Generate Base Price/Currency program copies the original base price record, calculates a new amount, and creates a price record with the new currency amount. The program creates only one new base price record for each unit of measure. It does not create a price record for a currency if the record already exists. The exception to this rule is when currency codes that are associated with an item have different effective through dates. Depending on the dates, the program might create more than one new price record.</p>
