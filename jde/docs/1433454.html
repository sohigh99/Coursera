<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding voiding automatic and manual payments and unreconciling payments. (P0413V<strong>).<br /></strong></p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Why does the system trigger a hard error when attempting to void a reconciled payment and how do I resolve this error?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong>  The system displays this error when the reconciled code field (alias RCND) is set to 'R' in the General Ledger table F0911. In order to void the payment, the field must have a blank value. You will need to un-reconcile the payment before it can be voided. For more information pertaining to unreconciling a reconciled transaction, please refer to Doc ID 664691.1 - Changing a Reconciled Transaction to Unreconciled (P09131) section.</p>
<p>The reconciliation for the payment needs to be reversed before it can be voided:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Use the Manual Reconciliation application (P09131) to reverse the reconciliation of the payment.</li>
<li>    Select the Update F0911 option from the Form Exit menu to refresh the General Ledger (F0911). If this table is not refreshed, the system will continue to trigger an error when attempting to void the payment.</li>
<li>    Void the payment using the Void Payment Entry (P0413M/P0413V).</li>
<li>    Post the voided payment.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong>  When attempting to void a payment, why do we receive an error that the check is reconciled, but when checking the reconciliation table it is not?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong>  If you are using several bank accounts for making A/P payments, there is a likelihood that there will be duplicate check numbers that are used across the several different banks (i.e. two different banks issue check number 1001). When attempting to void a check with a duplicate number, the system will not allow the void because there is another check that was written from a different bank that has the same check number and it has already been reconciled.  As a workaround, go into manual reconciliation and un-reconcile the other checks with the same check number, then void the desired payment. Once the desired payment is voided, return to the reconciliation program and reconcile the other checks again.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> Can the voiding of a check be reversed if it has not yet been posted?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> A voided check cannot be reversed or undone, regardless of the check's Post Status (data dictionary item POST). If this situation occurs, the void must be posted and a new payment entered into the system to replace the voided payment. In order to keep an audit trail, you can use the same original check number preceded by 9s. For example if the original check number was 1234, record the new check number as 99991234.</p>
<p>A voided payment cannot be reversed. If one was voided by mistake, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>    Continue processing the voided check. Post the void using the General Ledger Post UBE (R09801).</li>
<li>    Enter a new payment using the Manual Payment with Voucher Match application (P0413M), with the same check number, but with preceding 9s. For example, if the original check number was 1234 record the manual check number as 99991234 to create an audit trail.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Is it possible to delete a payment that has not yet been posted?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> The A/P Manual Payments (P0413M) application has two processing options on the Processing tab to determine if a payment that has not been posted can be deleted or if it must be voided::<br /><br />    Processing Option 4: Delete Unposted Automatic Payments - Determines whether the system allows the deletion of unposted automatic payments. Valid values are:<br />        Blank: Do not allow unposted automatic payments to be deleted. These payments must be voided.<br />        1: Allow unposted automatic payments to be deleted.<br />    Processing Option 5: Delete Unposted Manual Payments - Determines whether the system allows the deletion unposted manual payments. Valid values are:<br />        Blank: Do not allow unposted manual payments to be deleted. These payments must be voided.<br />        1: Allow unposted manual payments to be deleted.<br /><br />If unposted payments are deleted, the system permanently removes the corresponding records from the Matching Document Table (F0413) and Matching Document Detail Table (F0414). This option leaves no audit trail for the payment.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> Is it possible to void an entire batch of payments in one step?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> No. You must void each payment one at a time.  After all the payments in the batch have been voided, the batch needs to be posted using the General Ledger Post UBE (R09801) to record the reversing entries in the General Ledger (F0911).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> When trying to void a payment and its associated voucher that was created through the Procurement system, why does the system return an error?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong> Do not use the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Payable system to void vouchers that were created in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Procurement system. If a voucher is created in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Procurement system, it must be reversed in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Procurement system. Voiding such vouchers in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Payable system can impact the integrity of your purchasing data.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question 7:</strong><span> <strong>When voiding a Payment without Voucher Match, why is the Void Vouchers checkbox always selected?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Answer 7:</strong> A Payment without Voucher Match creates both the voucher and payment together as one document. The batch type for a batch containing these types of payments is W. If the payment is later voided, it is required that the voucher is voided as well. If the voucher is not voided, this leaves integrity issues in your system. For the same reason the checkbox is not only checked, but also greyed out, so it cannot be unchecked.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong> We found out the wrong voucher was paid, after the check was already sent to the bank. Is there a recommended way of resolving this?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8:</strong> You can choose between two options:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>    Request a debit memo (refund) from your supplier for the amount of the check. Once you receive this, enter it in the system as a PD doc type. You can then balance this debit memo against the correct voucher. Or</li>
<li>    Void the payment, and post the void. Void the voucher if needed, and post the void. Then via P0413M enter a new payment for the correct voucher, and use the check number of the voided payment. Make sure NOT to print the payment! Or if this happens automatically, destroy the print. Then post the payment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note: If the voucher was created from a purchase order, voiding the voucher must be completed from the P4314 program (Distribution/procurement side) only.  If the voucher is voided on the AP side, it will not re-open the purchase order.</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9: </strong>Why does the system throw an error message when trying to void a payment and its corresponding voucher(s) simultaneously?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 9:</strong> Verify if the voucher(s) are posted. If they have not been posted, the Void Voucher(s) check box (data dictionary item VOIDVR) on the Void Payment form (P0413V) cannot remove the vouchers because it was not designed to perform the Delete function.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong> When trying to void a payment, the user receives an error stating the payment needs to be un-reconciled first. However, when inquiring on the payment on the GL side, the payment is not reconciled, why?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10:</strong> If a company has several bank accounts that they use for making A/P payments, there is a high likelihood that there will be duplicate check numbers that are used across the several different banks (i.e. two different banks issue check number 1001). This causes the system to not allow the user to complete the void, because there is another check that was written from a different bank that has the same check number and it has already been reconciled. As a work-around, the user must go into Manual Reconciliation (P09131), and un-reconcile the other checks with the same check number, then void the desired payment. Then they must go back into the reconciliation program and reconcile the other checks again.</p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11</strong>: Is it possible to reverse the void of a payment?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11:</strong> No.  The system cannot reverse the void of a payment. Once a payment is voided, you cannot reverse the void to go back to the original status regardless of whether or not the void of the payment is posted. A new payment will need to be entered to replace the voided payment.<br /><br /><strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12</strong>: Is it possible to create a manual payment with the same check number of a missing or undo automatic payment?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12:</strong> Yes.  The same payment number can be used by a Manual Payment with Voucher Match (P0413M) if a payment with the same number and bank account do not exist in the system. The difference is in the Document Type; PN for manual payment versus the PK for automatic payments.</p>
