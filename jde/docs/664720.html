<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>General Questions</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why does an account have a 'M' in the Model Consolidation field but the corresponding Business Unit is not a Model?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> If a business unit is a model, all of the accounts in the business unit contain a 'M' in the Model/Consolidated field in the F0901 table. Otherwise, the Model/Consolidated field is blank.<br /><br />If you change a model business unit to a business unit that is not a model, you must run the Update Model/Consolidated Field program (R0006QD) to update the F0901 table. The system changes the Model/Consolidated field to blank for all of the accounts within the business unit.<br /><br />Likewise, if you change a business unit that is not a model to a model business unit, you must run the Update Model/Consolidated Field program to update the F0901 table. The system changes the Model/Consolidated field to M for all of the accounts within the business unit.<br /><br />For more information on, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1393249.1'>Document 1393249.1</a> Global Update: Update the Model/ Consolidated Field (R0006QD).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Can I merge two or more accounts/account ids into one account and account id?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Two account ids cannot be merged into one. You may consider possible workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>If erroneous entries were made into a wrong account, you can delete unposted batches and post to the correct batch or, if posted you can void the batch and reenter with the proper Short Account ID (GMAID). You can then change the posting code to not allow posting for the wrong account.</li>
<li>One option is to create a subsidiary account with one higher level of detail falling just under the good account in the chart and transfer the erroneous account's transactions into the account with the subsidiary. After you make the change, run the R09806 report <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1390947.1'>Document 1390947.1</a>. This will update historical information on F0911 and F0902. Please note that no other files will be affected apart from these two. Any other files that need to be updated with the new account structure needs to be done via SQL with help of database administrator. This will allow Financial reporting to use rollup to see the balances.</li>
<li>Another option is to have your database administrator change the AID, MCU, OBJ, SUB fields on the F0911 records and then run the R099102 Repost report and delete the wrong F0902 records and make sure the F0901 confirms that the wrong account is Non-Posting. Oracle Software Support never recommends using programs like SQL to make direct updates to data within a table. Proceed with caution and use this option at your own risk. Always have a backup prior to making any type of table change.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> What is the significance of Chart of Accounts Refresh and how is the F0909 table linked to the F0901 table?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 3:</strong> After you revise or delete an existing general ledger account or add a new account which updates Account Master (F0901) table, you must run the Refresh Chart of Accounts program (R0909R) to update the Chart of Accounts - Reference File table (F0909). The F0909 table is further used for Chart of Accounts reporting.<br /><br />The relationship between F0901 and F0909 is that if you add an account with the same object and subsidiary as an existing account, but with a different description or level of detail, the Refresh Chart of Accounts program retains the first occurrence of the object and subsidiary only for the chart of accounts. For example, assume account 3.5005.WEST has a description of Sales - West Virginia. You add account 1.5005.WEST with a description of Sales - Western Region. When you run the Refresh Chart of Accounts program, the system updates F0909 table with object account 5005 and the description Sales - Western Region.<br /><br />For more information on how to run R0909R report, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1435544.1'>Document 1435544.1</a> Refresh Chart of Accounts section.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong>&nbsp;I have added a new account but did not run Chart of Accounts Refresh (R0909R). Will this have any impact on Trial Balance rollup or Annual Close?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 4:</strong>&nbsp;Please note that if you add a new account and do not run R0909P report subsequently, this has absolutely no repercussions on either Trial Balance rollup or Annual Close. The Refresh Chart of Accounts program (R0909R) is only required to update the F0909 table which is further used for Chart of Accounts reporting. Basically the Chart of Accounts reporting implies a periodic review of your object accounts across all companies and business units, so that you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate any inconsistencies in the levels of detail.</li>
<li>Verify that similar types of accounts are set up for financial consolidations to function properly.</li>
<li>Determine which object account numbers are available if you need to add new accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can achieve this by Online Chart of Accounts (P0909) application or by running Chart of Accounts report (R0909P). The system displays object accounts in ascending order, regardless of business unit or company.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> What is the significance of Build Account Master Word Search Table program (R0901WS)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> The Build Account Master Word Search Table program (R0901WS) assists in an account search by building the keywords information in the Account Master Word Search table (F0901WS). If you add, change, or delete account information, you should run this program in update mode to refresh the table and ensure that you are searching the most current information. Once F0901WS table is build, you can use the Account Master Word Search program (P0901WS) to locate an account by specifying different keywords. To locate an account, enter a word or string of characters in the Search Word field. The Account Master Word Search program displays a list of all of the accounts containing that word or string of characters. For example, if you enter "accounts payable," the program displays all of the accounts that contain the word "accounts" and all of the accounts that contain the word "payable." For more information on R0901WS and P0901WS application, refer to Account Master Word Search section in <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1435544.1'>Document 1435544.1</a> Overview of the Chart of Accounts.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> How can I set system to enter third G/L Account Number instead of BU.OBJ.SUB while specifying an account?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 6:</strong> To enter account numbers in a format other than the standard EnterpriseOne format for seldom use, you must specify the format that you are using by preceding the account number with a prefix character symbol that identifies the third G/L Account Number format as defined in General Accounting Constants (P0000). If you will like to frequently enter the third G/L Account Number, leave the Symbol to Identify 3rd G/L Account# as Blank. For more information on Account Symbols, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1434211.1'>Document 1434211.1</a> Overview of General Accounting Constants (P0000).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:</strong> What is the significance of a header account?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 7:</strong> A header account is an account with Post Edit Code N or B. Typically header accounts do not contain data into F0911 or F0902 for AA ledger.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong>&nbsp;What is the impact of Fixed Asset Postig Edit Code (F0911.FPEC) field on the F1202 table?&nbsp;</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 8:</strong>&nbsp;The Fixed Asset Postig Edit Code (FPEC) field available in Account Master (F0901) table is not used in EnterpriseOne. There is an existing Enhancement <a href='/epmos/faces/BugDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=10858437' target='_blank' >Bug 10858437</a> requesting to add the functionality to use this field. However this field is currently being used in the World Software. When an account is setup with FPEC = either '1' or '2', the Asset Number must be inputted for the journal. For more information on the functionality added to World Software, you may refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/BugDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=10655746' target='_blank' >Bug 10655746</a>.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:</strong> Can a "." be use as part of the Business Unit, Object, or Subsidiary?&nbsp;</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 9:</strong> Since the "." is use in the system to separate the Business Unit, the Object, and the Subsidiary, the "." can not be use as character in Business Unit, Object, or Subsidiary. The use of the "." as character in the Business Unit, Object or Subsidiary, will end up in unpredictable results.</p>
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong>&nbsp;Is there a limitation to the number of accounts that can be added to the chart of accounts?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 10:</strong>&nbsp;The number of accounts is limited to 99,999,999. This is due to the Account ID (AID) field in F0901 being limited to 8 characters. Please refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1506485.1'>Document 1506485.1</a> for additional information.</p>
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong>&nbsp;Why are Object account descriptions for LOD 7 to 9 displaying as 21 to 23 characters instead of its maximum 30 characters?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 11:</strong>&nbsp;The Account description field (DL01) in P0901 is of 30 characters. Due to the indentation required for level of detail (LOD), description for LOD 9 object account is indented by 9 characters and only 21 characters will be displayed. This is a known issue and is functioning as per designed.</p>
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12: </strong>Why are some of the new accounts created in F0901 via the import feature not able to print on Trail Balance Report (R09410)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12: </strong>This is due to GMFMOD &nbsp;field updated as NULL instead of a &lt;blank&gt; space in F0901 for those missing account numbers.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Defining Chart of Accounts</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> Can I add accounts to the F0901 table by importing data from excel?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> The grid interface of Accounts by Business Unit (P0901) application form allows you to import the account information from an excel sheet.</p>
<p><img src="/epmos/main/downloadattachmentprocessor?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&attachid=664720.1:B&amp;clickstream=no" border="0" hspace="0" align="bottom" /></p>
<p>You can access the Account by Business Unit form (P0901) in following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Work with Business Units (P0006), select Row-Exit - Accts By BU</li>
<li>In Work with Accounts (P0901), select Row-Exit - Account By BU</li>
</ul>
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE:<br />
<ul>
<li>Do not modify the Object and Subsidiary fields in header.</li>
<li>The import feature will work for a single business unit at one instance and it would be required to import multiple times for multiple business units.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Can I add accounts to the F0901 table directly using SQL?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Oracle Software Support never recommends using programs like SQL to make direct updates to data within a table. Proceed with caution and use this option at your own risk. Always have a backup prior to making any type of table change. For information on setting up Chart of Accounts, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1435544.1'>Document 1435544.1</a> Overview of Chart of Accounts (P0901).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> What are the different options available for Account Separator Character?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> You setup Account Separator Character to divide the business unit, object and subsidiary elements in the General Accounting Constants (P0000) application. Consider the following guidelines while setting up Account Separator Character:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use any special character as separator characters except:</li>
<ul>
<li>'#' Invalid account prefix.</li>
<li>'\' Work order prefix.</li>
</ul>

<a name="aref_section218"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Are there any repercussions of skipping Level of Detail (LOD) while setting up chart of accounts?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> It is strongly recommended not to skip levels of detail when you assign a level of detail to an account. You assign a level of detail (LOD) to each account to control how amounts are rolled up, or summarized into a balance for reporting purposes. Nonsequential levels of detail may cause summarization errors in financial reports.</p>

<a name="aref_section220"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> Are there any guidelines for modifying the Posting Edit Code of an existing account from 'L' to 'S'?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> Whenever possible, avoid changing the Subledger Posting Edit Code on an account as this change requires direct updates to the data within the F0911 and/or F0902 tables using SQL. These type of direct updates to general ledger data are not recommended or supported by Oracle Software Support. When it is required to modify the posting edit code on an account from 'L' to 'S' to reduce the size of F0902 table, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Back up the Account Balances (F0902) table.</li>
<li>Delete the Account Balances (F0902) records via SQL with help of database administrator with selection criteria for the account (AID).</li>
<li>Rebuild the F0902 via Repost Account Ledger (R099102) report to create the correct F0902 records. Please refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1387474.1'>Document 1387474.1</a> on how to run R099102 Repost report.</li>
<li>R099102 will create single F0902 record per fiscal year per ledger type, since PEC 'S' posts subledgers in summary format.</li>
<li>In case an account has data across multiple fiscal years, the Repost (R099102) and Annual Close (R098201) programs should be run simultaneously one fiscal year at a time, beginning with the first year on the system to rebuild balance forward amounts. Please refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=664688.1'>Document 664688.1</a> on how to run R098201 Annual Close report.</li>

<a name="aref_section221"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is there a quicker way to modify multiple accounts rather than using Revise Single Account form?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> You can revise an account or multiple accounts using following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revise Single Account (P0901) - On the Work With Accounts form (P0901), select an account to open Revise Single Account.</li>
<li>Revise Accounts by Business Unit - On the Work With Accounts form (P0901), select an account and from the Row menu, select Account by BU.</li>
<li>Revise Accounts by Object/Subsidiary - On the Work With Accounts form (P0901), select an account and select Account by Obj/Sub from the Row menu.</li>
</ul>

<a name="aref_section222"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is there a batch process available to delete inactive accounts?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> You cannot delete an account that has a balance in the F0911 or F0902 tables, irrespective of the value of Account Posting Edit Code (PEC). Alternatively, you can delete accounts that do not contain transactions by running the Delete Account Master Records program (R09814). For more details, on what master tables does this report search before deletion, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1404783.1'>Document 1404783.1</a> Overview of Delete Account Master Records Program (R09814).</p>

<a name="aref_section225"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> Why do I get "Object Number Invalid as entered" error while trying to update an existing account?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 6:</strong> This error can occur if the object number entered is too long or using an invalid format for the mode of entry. Please check the the Account Flex Format Setup&nbsp;application (P0907) and review the length of Object Account Field being setup. For more information on setting up Flex Accounting, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1435544.1'>Document 1435544.1</a>.<br /><br /></p>

<a name="aref_section226"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:</strong>&nbsp;Why does the Taxable Account field show as blank for some accounts in Account Master (F0901) table?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 7:</strong>&nbsp;The Taxable Account (TXGL) field was added in Account Master (F0901) table as an enhancement <a href='/epmos/faces/BugDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=12486363' target='_blank' >Bug 12486363</a>&nbsp;starting with 8.9 EnterpriseOne release. The GL Account Taxable flag indicates whether a particular account is taxable or not. When the option is turned on at the Account Master level, the account is taxable. Per the current functionality, there could be two valid values for Taxable Account (TXGL) field:</p>
<ul>
<li>'1' - Account is Taxable. The system updates the record in the Account Master table (F0901) with 1 when the option is turned on.</li>
<li>'0' - Account is Non-Taxable. The system updates the default value if the option is not turned on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation with accounts having Taxable Account (TXGL) field blank may happen for the migrated data as no such option existed prior to the 8.9 release. So when copying an account from a migrated account with Taxable Flag already as Blank, the F0901 Taxable Flag will obviously be updated as Blank. On the other hand, the creation of new accounts will always update the value of Taxable Account to '0', if the check box is not selected.</p>

<a name="aref_section227"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">How to make it mandatory to enter an address book number for e.g. expense accounts.</span>?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8:</strong> There is not a functionality available to make the address book a required field for an specific account in the system. The programs like the Journal Entry (P0911) do not validate if there is or isn't&nbsp; an address book records enter for certain account, like&nbsp; it does with the post edit code for subledger type</p>
<a name="aref_section228"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:</strong>&nbsp;<span id="form1:panelPage1">Why do I get "Account Number Invalid " errorm, when trying to change PEC for a Job Cost type account from "I" Inactive to " " Blank?</span></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 9:</strong>&nbsp;If the object and subsidiary fields are blank than the account must have a non-posting edit code associated with it. It is recommended to enter a valid object or valid subsidiary number (allowing this account to have any edit code). If the object and subsidiary fields need to be blank, enter a valid NON-posting edit code such as an "N" for Non-posting or "I" for and Inactive account.</p>
<a name="aref_section229"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Account Category Codes</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section230"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> How can you access account category codes 24 - 43 in P0901 application?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> The behaviour of Account Category Codes varies from one release to another as follows:</p>
<p class="km"><strong>Xe - 8.9</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Xe, ERP8.0 and 8.9 releases, only Account Category Codes 1 - 23 were available and Category Codes 24-43 did not exist.</li>
<li>The Category Codes information is stored in Account Master (F0901) table along with rest of account information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="km"><strong>8.10</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Category codes 24-43 were added in 8.10 release and were initially designed to be used for China Localization.</li>
<li>As long as the Localization Country Code is set to 'CN' in the User Profile setting in P0092, the category code fields 24-43 will display in the P0901 application.</li>
<li>The latest category codes 24-43 are stored in the F0901C table, whereas the category codes 1 - 23 are stored in the F0901 table.</li>
</ul>
<p class="km"><strong>8.11 and later releases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 8.11 release and subsequent, the account category codes 21 - 43 were made available in the EnterpriseOne base product.</li>
<li>No country specific user profile settings are necessary to view the category codes in the P0901 application.</li>
<li>The latest category codes 24-43 are stored in the F0901 table along with category codes 1 - 23 and rest of account information.</li>
<li>F0901C table is obsolete in 8.11 and subsequent releases.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section231"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Why does the R09205P report not print the Account Category Codes 24 - 43?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> The Account Master Report (R09205P) will always capture category codes ranging only from 1 through 23. Its recommended to use the following reports to determine if the appropriate accounts are associated with the appropriate category reporting codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>R09205P - Account Master Report Cat. Code 01 - 23</li>
<li>R09206 - Account Master Report Cat. Code 24 - 33</li>
<li>R09207 - Account Master Report Cat. Code 34 - 43</li>
</ul>

<a name="aref_section232"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why do I get error: "Not found in User Defined Code 09/xx" while trying to add/modify an account?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> While setting up a new account or modifying an existing account, if you are planning to setup Account Category Codes 01 - 43 as blank, it will be required to add a blank value in the respective Category Code UDC with value of '.' in the Description field. For instance, for Account Category Code 25, setup a blank value of '.' in the Description field in the UDC 09/25. Since UDC values are stored in cache, it will be required to clear the cache to experience the effect.</p>

<a name="aref_section233"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Flex Accounting</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section234"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> Can the object length be changed in the account flex format setup (P0907)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> The Account Flex Format (P0907) program will allow changes to the existing account structure but currently there is no method of updating the existing chart of accounts in F0901 table and the corresponding transactions in order to align with the new account structure. Changing the structure after transactions have been entered will create discrepancies to the existing records and cause multiple errors throughout the software. The only workaround is to create a custom program and change the account structure after identifying all the affected tables.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section235"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it valid to setup an account structure like BU.OBJ.SUB.BU?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> The Account Flex Format (P0907) program allows user to define multiple segments for the Business Unit, Object and Subsidiary fields. For instance, you may setup two segments for the Business Unit, where one one of the segments appear before Object Account and the other after Subsidiary.<br /><br /><img src="/epmos/main/downloadattachmentprocessor?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&attachid=664720.1:A&amp;clickstream=no" /><br /><br />This kind of format is supported in flex accounting as long as the total length including account separating characters is less than or equal to 28.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section236"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> In an account structure like BU.OBJ.SUB.BU, is it possible to create accounts with blank values of Object Account or Subsidiary?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> No. It is not possible to have blank values of Object Account or Subsidiary with an account structure defined as BU.OBJ.SUB.BU. Lets take an example to understand this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Business Unit '000050P0001' in Work with Business Units (P0006)</li>
<li>Create two accounts in Work with Accounts (P0901) for the business unit created in Step 1:</li>
<ul>
<li>First account as 000050..001.P0001 with following attributes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Business Unit - 000050P0001</li>
<li>Object - Blank</li>
<li>Sub - 001</li>
</ul>
<li>Second account as 000050.1105..P0001 with following attributes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Business Unit - 000050P0001</li>
<li>Object - 1105</li>
<li>Sub - Blank</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Open Work with Journal Entries (P0911) and enter journal entry as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>Enter a JE with account as 000050..001.P0001 and it will throw error - "Blanks Invalid".</li>
<li>Enter another JE with account as 000050.1105..P0001 and it will throw error - "P0001 Has Too Many Parts".</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>The system throws an error since the long account numbers 000050..001.P0001 and 00050.1105..P0001 are incorrect as the intermediate segments are blank. While using the long account number only the last segment is allowed as blank. Hence for an account structure like BU.OBJ.SUB.BU, when using the long account number, object and subsidiary should not be left as blank.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section237"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Is there any limit to the size of account structure?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> The total length including account separating characters should be less than or equal to 28.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section238"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> Why is the Business Unit in the Account Number (ANI) field left justified instead of right justified?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> Per current design, the Data Dictionary display rule set for Business Unit Data Dictionary Item (MCU) is *RAB (Right Adjust Blank Fill). It implies that the Business unit field will display right aligned. In case, Account Flex setup is changed from the default value i..e. MCU = 12, OBJ = 4, and SUB = 8, it will be considered as Flex Accounting used and the Validate Account Number Business Function (XX0901) will concatenate MCU, OBJ and SUB and make Account Number (ANI) field as left aligned and will ignore the Data Dictionary display rule. For more information on Flex Accounting validation, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=1372342.1'>Document 1372342.1</a> XX0901 - Business Function Detail Information.</p>
<a name="aref_section239"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Account Translations</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section240"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong>&nbsp;Why do I see the account description in English in Work with Accounts (P0901) application even the user profile is setup with language other than English?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 1:</strong>&nbsp;Please note that the Work with Accounts (P0901/W0901H) application is based on F0901 table whereas the language translations having alternate descriptions are stored in the F0901D table. The non-english description is visible in P0911, P09200 and other applications and reports which use alternate description from F0901D but not P0901 which reads account description from F0901. Hence this is functioning as designed.</p>
<p class="km">An Enhancement <a href='/epmos/faces/BugDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664720.1&id=17385639' target='_blank' >Bug 17385639</a> has been entered to enhance the P0901 application design by adding an additional description field in order to show the translated account description as setup in the Account Translation (F0901D)&nbsp;table.</p>
<a name="aref_section241"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong>&nbsp;Why does the system not show the modified language translation description, during copying of an account?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong>&nbsp;If the Account Description (F0901) for the copied account has been changed, in that case the corresponding Translational Information (F0901D) needs to be changed manually.</p>
<a name="aref_section242"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong>&nbsp;Is there any program to upload the Account Translations into F0901D table?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, there is no such feature to upload directly to the Account translation (F0901D) table. Hence, it need to be updated via P0901 application only. As a workaround, you may consider setting up a model business unit with a set of chart of accounts. &nbsp;The translation will need to be updated together. When a new BU needs to be created, &nbsp;you may use the Copy feature in Work with Business Units (P0006) application to copy the range of accounts from the model BU to the new BU. &nbsp;In this case, all the accounts with the translation in F0901D &nbsp;will be created together.</p>
