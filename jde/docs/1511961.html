<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document explains the use of the Quick Hire application (P060016Q) to add multiple employees, applicants, new hires and rehires.</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="SCOPE"></A>Scope</H2>
<p>&nbsp;This document is intended for EnterpriseOne users who are setting up the Human Resources and Payroll modules for use by their organization.</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="BODYTEXT"></A>Details</H2>
<a name="aref_section31"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Overview of Employee Quick Hire</strong></h3>
<p>You can use Employee Quick Hire (P060116Q) to add multiple employee records when you hire groups of individuals that have common job information.&nbsp; Using Employee Quick Hire reduces typing errors and data entry time.&nbsp; You can define the common job information as default information that the system supplies for each employee record that you add.&nbsp; You must also set the processing options to define certain default information and processes related to Employee Quick Hire.</p>
<p>Employee Quick Hire offers a robust capability to track various types of user-defined information.&nbsp; Thirty category code fields are available for tracking address book codes that can be assigned to addresses in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Address Book system.&nbsp; Twenty category codes are available for tracking JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Payroll system information.&nbsp; Ten category codes are available that can be used to specify employee eligibility for participation in various user-defined plans or activities.</p>
<a name="aref_section32"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Understanding New Employee Information Tasks</strong></h3>
<p>When you hire a new employee into an organization, you need to perform many tasks to prepare for the new employee and to ensure that any preliminary employment activities are completed.&nbsp; These tasks might vary depending on the employee's location and job duties.&nbsp; For example, an administrative assistant might need to have a telephone, computer, network sign-on, ID badge, parking sticker, and building key to start working.&nbsp; A hospital nurse might need to have an ID badge, parking sticker, and locker assignment, and to have completed a blood test and attended safety orientation prior to starting work.&nbsp; Most new employee setup tasks require management approval, and these approvals might have been accomplished by routing a paper approval form.&nbsp; The new hire employee setup program automates and streamlines the initiation of these tasks by sending E-mail messages through workflow to the individuals responsible for completing these tasks.</p>
<p>When you add employee records using Employee Quick Hire (P060116Q), you can set an Employee Quick Hire processing option to specify whether the new employee information updates the Employee Master Information (F060116), Address Book Master (F0101), Requisition Activity (F08105), and Applicant Master (F08401) tables as you complete the process.&nbsp; Or you can set the processing option to store the new employee information in the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table (F060116Z).&nbsp; Storing the information in this table allows you to review and revise the information before running the Process Pending Employees report (R060116P) to update the other tables.&nbsp; Please note that if you are allowing Address Book Numbers to generate, the address book number will not generate until you run the R060116P Process Pending Employees.</p>
<p>If the Employee Quick Hire processing option is set to update the F060116Z table, you must complete one or more of these tasks after you add the employee records:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the Process Pending Employees report.</li>
<li>Revise new employee records.</li>
<li>Purge pending employee information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Process Pending Employees report updates the F060116 and F0101 tables after you review and revise the new employee records.</p>
<p>You can add, change, or delete the new employee records from the F060116Z table.&nbsp; Revising new employee records is mandatory if you find errors in the R060116P report.&nbsp; You must correct the errors and rerun the report to update the Employee Master and Address Book Master tables with the new employee information.</p>
<a name="aref_section33"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Understanding the Relationship Between Quick Hire and New Hire</strong></h3>
<p>The Employee Quick Hire program (P060116Q) integrates with the Employee Setup Workbench program (P08710) by automatically generating the setup record and initiating a workflow process.&nbsp; For the two programs to integrate, you must set the processing options appropriately on Employee Quick Hire.&nbsp; These steps are performed when you integrate the Employee Quick Hire program with the Employee Setup Workbench program to initiate the new hire setup workflow process:</p>
<ol>
<li>When an employee record is added to the Employee Master Information table (F060116) through Employee Quick Hire, the system automatically creates the new Hire Employee setup record.</li>
<li>The system automatically sends an E-mail message to the employee's supervisor, requesting the supervisor to identify the setup tasks necessary for the employee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system determines which supervisor to E-mail based on the entry in the Supervisor field in the Employee Quick Hire program.&nbsp; If the new hire option is activated the supervisor field is required.</li>
<li>Using Manager Self-Service, the new employee's manager uses the Employee Setup Workbench program to enter the setup tasks that are necessary for the employee.&nbsp; The setup tasks can also be supplied automatically based on the employee's job type.&nbsp; In Quick Hire, job type is required when the new hire option is activated.</li>
<li>When the tasks are identified for the new employee and the employee setup record is approved, the system initiates the new hire setup workflow process, which send an E-mail message to the individuals in your organization who are responsible for completing the necessary tasks.&nbsp; For example, if the manager indicates that the new employee needs a network signon, security badge, and building key, the workflow process sends E-mail to the IT Manager, Security Manager, and Facilities Manager, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can customize the new hire setup Workflow process to meet the needs of your organization.&nbsp; Processing options for the Employee Setup Workbench program enable you to easily customize the process.&nbsp; For example, your organization might choose to require approval at the process level or at the task level.&nbsp; Or, you might choose to escalate certain tasks if the designated individuals do not complete the tasks in an appropriate time frame.</p>
<a name="aref_section34"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Setting Up Default Information for Employee Records</strong></h3>
<p>Before you add employee records for individuals with similar job information, you set up the job information as default information to reduce data entry time.&nbsp; Then when you add employee records, Employee Quick Hire supplies the default information.&nbsp; For example, if you are hiring 50 production employees for the same business unit who have the same supervisor, you set up the Job Type, Business Unit, and Supervisor fields as default information.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can change the default information for each group of employees for whom you are going to enter records.</p>
<p>From the Employee Quick Hire application (P060116Q), access the Pending Employee Defaults form by selecting Defaults from the form option menu.</p>
<p><img src="../images/hr020.png" border="0" alt="Pending Employee Defaults" title="Pending Employee Defaults" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Business Unit</strong> - Enter an alphanumeric code that identifies a separate entity within a business for which you want to track costs.&nbsp; For example, a business unit might be a warehouse location, job, project, work center, branch, or plant.&nbsp; You can assign a business unit to a document, entity, or person for purposes of responsibility reporting.&nbsp; For example, the system provides reports of open accounts payable and accounts receivable by business unit to track equipment by responsible department.&nbsp; Business unit security might prevent you from viewing information about business units for which you have no authority.</li>
<li><strong>Home Business Unit</strong> - The number of the business unit in which the employee generally works.<br /><strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Home Company</strong> - Enter the company number where the employee records generally reside.</li>
<li><strong>Date Pay Starts</strong> - Enter the date that an employee may begin participating in the company's benefit plans or may be included in payroll processing.&nbsp; You can also use this field to provide a beginning date for seasonal employees or for employees who work only part of the year (such as a teacher who works only nine months of the year).</li>
<li><strong>Date Started</strong> - Enter the first day the employee started working at your company.&nbsp; If you do not enter a date, the system uses the value in the Original Hire Date field.</li>
<li><strong>Date of Original Employment</strong> - Enter the date on which the employee was originally hired by the company.&nbsp; If the employee was terminated and subsequently rehired, the data in the Date Started (DST) field represents the new start date.</li>
<li><strong>Job Type</strong> - A user defined code (06|G) that defines the jobs within your organization.</li>
<li><strong>Job Step -&nbsp; </strong>A user-defined code (06/GS) that indicates a specific level within a particular job type.<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Supervisor</strong> - Enter the address book number of the supervisor.</li>
<li><strong>Check Route Code</strong> - A user defined code (07/CR) that specifies the check routing or mail-stop code. Use this code to sequence the printing of payroll checks to facilitate their handling and delivery.<br /><strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Locality</strong> - Enter a code from UDC 07/SL that defines the different salary localities within an organization.&nbsp; For example, you can compare salaries for employees on the East Coast with employees in the Midwest.</li>
<li><strong>Participation Date</strong> - Enter the date the employee began participating in the company deferred income or stock option plan.&nbsp; This date must be later than the date in the Date Started field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting the option next to each field that you completed and clicking OK activates the field and allows the system to recognize the field as a default value.&nbsp; If you activate a blank field, the system overwrites the field for each record that is entered in the Employee Quick Hire form.</p>
<a name="aref_section35"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Adding Employee Records for Applicants, Rehires, and New Hires</strong></h3>
<p>After you offer employment to individuals who have common job information, you can use Employee Quick Hire (P060116Q) to add multiple employee records to the Employee Master Information table (F060116) with minimal data entry.&nbsp; You can add employee records for applicants, rehires, and new hires.&nbsp; To add employee records for applicants, you select the applicants from the Applicant Master table (F08401).&nbsp; Employee Quick Hire automatically copies the applicant's information to the Employee Quick Hire form.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can add employee records for rehires or groups of terminated employees. &nbsp;When you select the record in Employee Quick Hire, the system searches the individual's information in the Employee Master Information table for a termination date with the associated Tax ID, Employee Number, or Alternate Number.&nbsp; When the system finds the search criteria it copies the information from the record to the Employee Quick Hire form.</p>
<p>The system also searches for a duplicate employee number.&nbsp; This process prevents the system from duplicating employees and employee numbers in the database.&nbsp; To add employee records for new hires, you enter employee information in the required fields on the Employee Quick Hire form.&nbsp; The default information and processing options that you already defined minimize the number of fields that you need to enter.&nbsp; Also, if the processing options are set appropriately, a new hire record is created automatically in the Employee Setup Workbench program (P08710) for self-service.</p>
<p>These scenarios are examples of situations in which you might use Employee Quick Hire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your company has acquired another company and you need to enter the newly acquired employees into JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.&nbsp; Using Employee Quick Hire, you can enter the new employees in groups based on their supervisor.&nbsp; You might decide to specify the start date, supervisor, business unit, home company, and locality as default information.</li>
<li>Your company uses seasonal employees and rehires many of the same employees each year.&nbsp; Using Employee Quick Hire, you can select the employees that are eligible for rehire from the terminated employee database and activate their employee records.&nbsp; In addition, you might choose to specify the pay start date and the supervisor as default information.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add employee records with Employee Quick Hire, you can set an Employee Quick Hire processing option to specify whether the new employee information updates the Employee Master Information, Address Book Master (F0101), Requisition Activity (F08105), and Applicant Master (F08401) tables as you complete the process.&nbsp; Or you can set the processing option to store the new employee information in the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table (F060116Z).&nbsp; Storing the information in this table allows you to review and revise the employee records before running the Process Pending Employees program (R060116P) to update the tables.</p>
<p>If you set the processing option to directly update the Employee Master Information and other tables, the system also updates the HR History table (F08042).&nbsp; If you set the processing option to use the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table, the system does not update the HR History table until you run the Process Pending Employees program.</p>
<p>You can also set a processing option to activate the new hire process.&nbsp; This process automatically updates the Address Book table and the Employee Setup Master table (F08710).</p>
<p>You can set processing options to automatically supply various types of information that will reduce the time required to use the Employee Quick Hire process.&nbsp; For example, you can set a processing option so that the system supplies all the job information related to a specific job type when you enter the job type on Employee Quick Hire.</p>
<p>You can also set an Employee Quick Hire processing option so that the system copies the applicant's supplemental data to the new employee record.&nbsp; If you do this, you also need to set the Transfer Supplemental Data processing option in the XJDE0001 version of the Applicant Entry program (P08401).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prerequisites</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up default information for every new group of individuals that you hire with similar job information.</li>
<li>If you need to initiate the employee setup process after you add employee records, set the processing option for Employee Quick Hire on the Action tab to activate the new hire process.</li>
<li>If you want the system to automatically supply a range of information for job type, job category codes, business unit, or supplemental data, set the applicable processing options for Employee Quick Hire on the Defaults and Versions tabs.</li>
</ul>
<a name="aref_section36"></a><h4 class="km">Setting Processing Options for Employee Quick Hire (P060116Q)</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp; Applicant Information Version - Specify the version of the Applicant Entry program (P08401) that the system should use for transferring applicant information.&nbsp; If the applicant records that you are adding include supplemental data, you can specify a program version that the system uses to transfer the supplemental data along with the applicant information to the new employee records.&nbsp; If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses the default version, ZJDE0001, which does not transfer supplemental data.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox" style="margin-left: 30px;">Note:&nbsp; &nbsp;For the system to transfer an applicant's supplemental data, you must also set a processing option to transfer supplemental data in the processing options for the Applicant Entry program (P08401).</div>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Address Book MBF Version (address book master business function version) - Specify the version of the Address Book Master Business Function (MBF) that the system uses.&nbsp; If you are using interoperability transactions, you might want to specify a version that updates the Address Book table (F0101).&nbsp; If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses the default version, ZJDE0001.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox" style="margin-left: 30px;">
<p>Note:&nbsp; &nbsp;If you specify an Address Book MBF version, you must also set a processing option to indicate the interoperability outbound transaction in the processing options for the Address Book Master Business Function (P0100041).</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">3.&nbsp; Address Book Search Form Version - Specify the version to use for the Address Book Search form.&nbsp; If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses the default version, ZJDE0001.</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;0:&nbsp; Update only the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table.</li>
<li>&nbsp;1:&nbsp; Update all of the linked tables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">If you set the processing option to 0, you can review and revise the employee information before the system updates the tables.&nbsp; After you review and revise information, you need to run the Process Pending Employees program (R060116P) to update the tables.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">2.&nbsp; New Hire - Specify whether to activate the new hire process.&nbsp; Values are:</p>

<p>The Process Pending Employees report (R060116P) updates the Employee Master Information table (F060116) and the Address Book Master table (F0101) with information from the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table (F060116Z).</p>
<p>The R060116P report generates an error report in all cases.&nbsp; If the system finds errors or incomplete employee records, error messages are printed and the databases are not updated with the new employee information.&nbsp; If no errors are found, the report indicates that none occurred.&nbsp; This report compares all new information to the data in the F060116 file before any of the new information is transferred.&nbsp; If you receive error messages, you can use the Employee Work File Revisions program (P060116P) to correct employee records and then rerun the report to update the F060116 and F0101 tables with the new employee records.&nbsp; The system processes each record individually.&nbsp; The system records a completed status for each record when updates to the F060116 and F0101 tables are successful.</p>

<a name="aref_section39"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Revising New Employee Records</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure accuracy of your new employee records, you can add, change, or delete records from the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table (F060116Z) before or after running the Process Pending Employees report (R060116P).&nbsp; If you need to correct errors that display in the Process Pending Employees report (R060116P), you can use the Employee Work File Revisions program (P060116P) to make changes that the system saves in the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File (F060116Z).&nbsp; You need to correct the errors and then rerun the report to update the Employee Master Information (F060116) and Address Book Master (F0101) tables.&nbsp; The system saves the entire batch of records in the Employee Master Information and Address Book Master tables only when the report runs successfully.</p>
<p>Access the Work With Pending Employees (P060116P) - Complete any or all fields shown below, Click Find.&nbsp; Select an employee to be revised.</p>
<!-- <p><img src="/epmos/main/downloadattachmentprocessor?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=1511961.1&attachid=1511961.1:A&amp;clickstream=no" border="0" alt="Work With Pending Employees" title="Work With Pending Employees" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p> -->
<p><strong>User ID</strong> - Enter the source of the transaction.&nbsp; This can be a user ID, a workstation, the address of an external system, a node on a network, and so on.&nbsp; This field helps identify both the transaction and its point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Number</strong> - Enter the number that an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transmitter assigns to a transaction.&nbsp; In a non-EDI environment, you can assign any number that is meaningful to you to identify a transaction within a batch.&nbsp; It can be the same as a JD Edwards EnterpriseOne document number.</p>
<p><strong>Batch Number -&nbsp;</strong>Enter the batch number of the records you want to review.</p>
<p>You can select to view 'All' records or just 'Unprocessed' records.</p>
<a name="aref_section310"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Purging Pending Employee Information</strong></h3>
<p>After you update the Employee Master Information (F060116) and Address Book Master (F0101) tables with batches of new employee records, you need to purge the information from the Unedited Quick Hire Transaction File table (F060116Z) occasionally to free up space in the table.&nbsp; Purging the table removes the information so that you can continue to add new employee records.&nbsp; You can run this process if you are experiencing performance problems with Employee Quick Hire or if you want to avoid scrolling through many processed employee records to view the ones for which you are looking.&nbsp; Purge Pending Employees (R060116PP) is run from the Employee Quick Hire Menu, or from Batch Versions.</p>
