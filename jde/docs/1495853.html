<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2><p>
<a name="aref_section11"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Overview of Credit Analysis Refresh (R03B525)</strong></h3>
<p>To effectively analyze and manage account activity for a customer, you must first update the customer&rsquo;s account information. To do so, run the Credit Analysis Refresh program (R03B525) at the beginning or end of each business day. This ensures that the information that the system displays for the customer&rsquo;s account is current and helpful when you analyze the customer&rsquo;s account for credit and collection purposes.</p>
<p>When you run the Credit Analysis Refresh program, the system includes all the customers with an open balance (regardless of whether the balance is past due) in the Credit and Cash Management table (F03B15) and displays the balances on the Account Balance Inquiry form. You must select a version of this program that has the processing option set to update the F03B15 table for the program to perform these functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize all open invoice activity by customer account and company at both the parent and child levels, and write this information to the F03B15 table. You can then review this information on the Account Balance Inquiry or Parent/Child Browse form to determine the current status of an account.</li>
<li>Send a workflow message to the collection manager for accounts that require collection review by the collection manager. For example, the system can alert the collection manager when a delinquency fee is assessed on an overdue invoice or when a delinquency notice is generated for a customer.</li>
<li>Send a workflow message to the credit manager for accounts that require credit review. For example, the system might indicate that a customer has exceeded the credit limit or that a credit limit was changed.</li>
<li>Update the credit messages on the Credit tab of the Customer Master Revision form.</li>
<li>Update invoices eligible for external collections, as well as the Collection Report option on the customer record.</li>
<li>Update the temporary credit message on the customer record based on the policy.</li>
<li>Reset the temporary credit message to the value of the credit message based on the policy.<br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">Note. You must include Pay Status equals 'P' in the data selection for the system to perform the reset function. Consider running a version of the program with this data selection once a week to reset temporary credit messages. The system will not display current invoice information in the Account Balance Inquiry or Parent/Child Balance Inquiry programs until you rerun the program with the data selection set to include open invoices.</div>
 </li>
<li>Generate a workflow message to notify you that the process is complete.</li>
<li>As of release 9.0, the R03B525 also updates the F03B15 Tag Table (F03B15T) when the F03B15 is updated - see Bug 11043633 for further information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations</strong></p>
<p>When you run Credit Analysis Refresh, the system creates a minimum of two records in the Credit and Cash Management table (F03B15) for each customer. For example, if you enter one invoice for customer 1234 for company 00001, the system creates these records in the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>One record for the child information (RTPART = C) for the company that the invoice was entered against (RTCO = 00001).</li>
<li>One record for the child information (RTPART = C) for company 00000.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system uses the record for company 00000 to total the information for all company records. If you had invoices entered for multiple companies, the system would generate additional records, one record for each company.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use Accounts Receivable Constants to specify how the system ages customer&rsquo;s invoice information, unless you select to use the aging categories in the Credit Analysis Refresh (R03B525) processing options. See <a href='../docs/1982405.html'>Overview and Setup of Accounts Receivable Constants and Enhanced A/R Constants for Line of Business and Date-Effective Category Code Processing</a> for further information on AR Constants.</li>
<li>Ensure that the R03B525 processing option to update the F03B15 table is blank.</li>
</ul>

<a name="aref_section32"></a><h4 class="km">Setting Processing Options for Credit Analysis Refresh (R03B525)</h4>
<p>Processing options enable you to specify the default processing for programs and reports.</p>
<p><em>Aging Tab</em> - These processing options specify how the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable system ages customer&rsquo;s invoice information. For example, you define the information that the system uses to determine whether an account is delinquent, and if it is, the number of days it is delinquent:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aging method.</li>
<li>The date on which the aging is based.</li>
<li>The beginning and ending aging categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the "as of" date, date type, and aging method that you specify in the processing options, the system determines which aging category to assign each open invoice. If the invoice is assigned to an aging category for which a delinquency policy has been established, the system generates a notice if that processing option is activated. See <a href='../docs/945008.html'>How To Use Credit Analysis Refresh In EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable (R03B525)</a> for further information on how invoices are aged in Accounts Receivable.</p>
<ol>
<li>A/R Company Constants - Specify whether the system retrieves aging specifications from the Accounts Receivable constants or from the Aging processing options. Values are:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Blank: Use the values specified in the Aging processing options.</li>
<li>1: Use the values specified in the Accounts Receivable constants. If the Age as of Date field in the A/R constants is blank, the system uses the value in the Aging Date processing option. If the value in the Aging Date processing option is also blank, the system uses the current date. The system ignores processing options 2 through 12 when you select this option, unless it required the Aging Date from processing option 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aging Date - Specify the date that you want the system to use to determine the aging category to which to assign open invoices. The system compares the date that you enter to the date on the invoice, as specified by the Date Type processing option, to determine the number of days the invoice is past due. If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses today&rsquo;s date to age open invoices.</li>
<li>Date Type - Specify the date on the invoice that you want the system to use to determine the aging category. The system compares the date that you specify to the value in the Date: Age As Of processing option to determine the number of days the invoice is past due. Values are:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Blank: Use the invoice due date.</li>
<li>1: Use the invoice date.</li>
<li>2: Use the G/L date.</li>
<li>3: Use the statement date.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aging Method (1, 2, 3) -  Specify which aging categories the system uses to assign invoices. The system uses the date specified in the Aging Date processing option and the value specified in the Date Type processing option to calculate the aging for each invoice, and then assigns them to the aging category specified by this code. Values are:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>1: Aging days. The system assigns invoices to the aging categories specified in the Aging Category 1 through Aging Category 8 processing options. The aging categories are user defined.</li>
<li>2: Fiscal periods. The system uses the fiscal periods defined by the date pattern assigned to the company record as the aging categories.</li>
<li>3: Calendar. The system uses each calendar month as an aging category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aging Category 1 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1). Note. The system does not print the future aging category on delinquency notices.  </li>
<li>Aging Category 2 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Aging Category 3 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Aging Category 4 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Aging Category 5 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Aging Category 6 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Aging Category 7 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Aging Category 8 - Use processing options 5 - 12 to specify the interval that the system uses for the aging categories if you are not using the AR Constants for aging (see processing option 1).</li>
<li>Unapplied Receipts Aging - Specify the aging method to unapplied receipts. Values are:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Blank: The system does not age unapplied receipts. The system does not include the unapplied receipt amount in any aging category, including Current.</li>
<li>1: Use the aging method that you specify in the Date Type processing option on the Aging tab.</li>
<li>2: Use the Current aging column for all unapplied receipts.</li>
<li>3: Apply the unapplied receipt to the oldest open invoice or group of invoices in a customer&rsquo;s account. For example, if you have invoices in aging categories 1- 30, 60 - 90, and 150 - 180, the system applies the receipt to the 150 - 180 aging category until all invoices are paid, and then applies unapplied receipts to the 60 - 90 aging category until all invoices are paid, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit Amount Aging - Specify the aging method for credit invoices. Values are:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Blank: Does not age credit invoices.</li>
<li>1: Use the aging method you specify in the Date Type processing option (Aging tab).</li>
<li>2: Use the Current aging column for all credit invoices.</li>
<li>3: Apply the credit invoice to the oldest open invoice or group of invoices in a customer&rsquo;s account. For example, if you have invoices in aging categories 1 - 30, 60 - 90, and 150 - 180, the system applies the credit invoice to the 150 - 180 aging category until all invoices are paid, and then applies credit invoices to the 60 - 90 aging category until all invoices are paid, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Update Tab</em> - This processing option specifies whether the system updates the Credit and Cash Management table (F03B15).</p>
<ol>
<li>Update Credit Cash Management Table (F03B15) -Use this processing option to update the Credit and Cash Management table (F03B15) with open invoice and aging amounts. Values are:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Blank: The system updates the F03B15 table.</li>
<li>1: The system does not update the F03B15 table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Notices Tab</em> - These processing options specify how the system generates delinquency notices. You can specify options such as generation mode (proof or final), version, and the "remit to" address. See <a href='../docs/644234.html'>Processing and Purging Delinquency Notices (R03B525, R03B20, R03B21, P03B202, P03B201, R03B5010) for further information on Delinquency Notices</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate Delinquency Notices - Specify how the system generates delinquency notices. Values are:
<ul>
<li>Blank: The system does not generate delinquency notices.</li>
<li>0: Proof mode. The system generates a report that includes all customers who are eligible to receive a delinquency notice and the invoices that are delinquent for each customer.</li>
<li>1: Final mode. The system generates a delinquency notice for each eligible customer and updates these tables:
<ul>
<li>A/R Notification History (F03B20)</li>
<li>A/R Notification History Detail (F03B21)</li>
<li>Customer Ledger (F03B11)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notice Print Program - Specify the Delinquency Notice Print Program that you want the system to run when you generate delinquency notices. You can select one of the standard programs, or create a custom print program. If you leave this field blank the system uses R03B20. The available standard programs are:
<ul>
<li>R03B20: A/R Delinquency Notices Print</li>
<li>R03B21: Global Reminders (Also referred to as Tiered Delinquency Notice Print in later releases)<br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: Both R03B20 and R03B21 have processing options associated with them.</div>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version for Notices - Specify the version of the delinquency notice print program specified in the Notice Print Program processing option. If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses ZJDE0001.</li>
<li>Remit To Address - Specify the remit to address that appears on the delinquency notice. The remit to address indicates where the customer should send payments. The system retrieves this address based on the address book record that is set up for the company that is designated on the invoice in the Address Book Master table (F0101). Values are: <br />
<ul>
<li>Blank: Use the address of the company designated on the F03B11 invoice record. The system retrieves the address book number of the company from the Company Constants table (F0010). NOTE: If you select to consolidate notices for all companies, the system uses the address of the company with the lowest company number for which that customer has open invoices. For example, if the customer has open invoice in companies 00001, 00050, and 00070, the system uses the address for company 00001.</li>
<li>A: Use the value in the 1st Address Number field (AN81) of the company record.</li>
<li>B: Use the value in the second Address Number field (AN82) of the company record.</li>
<li>C: Use the value in the third Address Number field (AN83) of the company record.</li>
<li>D: Use the value in the fourth Address Number field (AN84) of the company record.</li>
<li>E: Use the value in the Factor/Special Payee field (AN85) of the company record.</li>
<li>F: Use the value in the 5th Address Number field (AN86) of the company record.</li>
<li>Address: Specify an address book number that you want the system to use instead of the company&rsquo;s address book number. <br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: You can specify that the system omits printing the Remit To address by setting the processing option in the A/R Delinquency Notices Print (R03B20) or the Global Reminders program (R03B21).</div>
 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consolidate Companies - Specify how the system generates notices. Values are:
<ul>
<li>Blank: The system generates a separate notice for each company, by customer.</li>
<li>1: The system generates notices that consolidate companies, by customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine Severity Level - Specify whether the system locates the notification instructions (policy) based on the aging category or the severity level of the invoice. Values are:
<ul>
<li>Blank: Use the aging category.</li>
<li>1: Use the total number of reminders sent to determine the severity level. For example, if the number of reminders (notices) sent is 2, the system searches for a policy that specifies 3 in the Aging Category/Severity field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display non-delinquent Invoices - Use this processing option to control the invoice detail printed on delinquency notices. Values are:
<ul>
<li>Blank: Display only delinquent invoices in detail. No credits are displayed.</li>
<li>1: Display all invoices in detail, including credits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Fees Tab</em> - These processing options specify how the system generates delinquency fees. You can specify options such as generation mode (proof or final), version, the payment terms to assign to the fee record and its currency. See <a href='../docs/645354.html'>Processing and Purging Delinquency Fees (R03B525, R03B22, R03B221, R03B222, P03B22) for further information on delinquency fee processing.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Print Fee Report - Specify how the system generates delinquency fees. Values are:
<ul>
<li>Blank: Do not generate delinquency fees.</li>
<li>0: Proof Mode. The system generates an A/R Delinquency Fee Journal, which is a listing of the fees that the system will generate when you run the program in Final Mode. The system does not update any tables.</li>
<li>1: Final Mode. The system generates an RF invoice document in the amount of the fee in the Customer Ledger (F03B11) table. The system also generates records in the A/R Fee Journal History (F03B22) and A/R Fee Journal History Detail (F03B23) tables and prints an A/R Delinquency Fee Journal. The system updates the Last Fee Date in the Customer Ledger (F03B11) and A/R Check Detail (F03B14) tables with the date that fees were generated. Subsequent fees for the same invoice will not be generated until the number of days between fees has elapsed, as defined in the policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version for Fee Processing - Specify the version of the A/R Delinquency Fee Journal program (R03B22) that the system uses to generate delinquency fees. If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses version ZJDE0001.<br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: The A/R Delinquency Fee Journal has associated processing options. See <a href='../docs/645354.html'>How To Process, Purge and Troubleshoot Delinquency Notices (R03B525, R03B20, R03B21, P03B202, P03B201, R03B5010)</a>.</div>
</li>
<li>G/L Date - Specify the G/L date that you want the system to assign to delinquency fee (RF) invoice records. The system generates these invoices when you process delinquency fees in Final Mode. If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses today&rsquo;s date.</li>
<li>Late Payment Delinquency Fees - Use this processing option to run the Late Payment Delinquency Fees program (R03B221), which generates a delinquency fee on invoices that were paid after the due date. Values are:
<ul>
<li>Blank: Do not calculate fees on amounts that were paid after the due date.</li>
<li>1: Calculate fees on amounts that were paid after the due date.<br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: You must have the option 'Calculate On Paid Late Amounts' activated in the policy in addition to setting this processing option. See <a href='../docs/1490134.html'>How To Set Up Delinquency Notices and Fees (P03B2501, P03B2801)</a> for further information on delinquency fee policy set up.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version for Late Payment - Specify the version of the Late Payment Delinquency Fees program (R03B221) that you want the system to use to generate fees on invoices that were paid after the due date. If you leave this processing option blank, the system uses version ZJDE0001.<br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: The Late Payment Delinquency Fee program has associated processing options. See <a href='../docs/645354.html'>How To Process, Purge and Troubleshoot Delinquency Notices (R03B525, R03B20, R03B21, P03B202, P03B201, R03B5010)</a>.</div>
</li>
<li>Payment Terms Code - Specify the Payment Terms Code that you want the system to assign to the delinquency fee (RF) invoice record.</li>
<li>Currency of Fees - Specify the currency that the system uses to generate delinquency fee invoice records (document type RF). The system uses the most recent exchange rate from the Currency Exchange Rates table (F0015) to calculate the currency fee amount. Values are:
<ul>
<li>1: Company. Generate the fee in the currency that is assigned to the company record that appears on the invoice.</li>
<li>2: Customer. Generate the fee in the currency that is assigned to the A/B Amount Codes field (CRCA) of the customer record in the Customer Master by Line of Business table (F03012).</li>
<li>3: Invoice. Generate the fee in the currency that is assigned to the invoice at the time that the invoice was entered.<br /><br />
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: Regardless of the option that you select, the system generates one fee invoice (RF) record per currency code for each company. For example, if companies 00001 and 00003 are assigned a currency code for Canadian dollars (CAD), the system generates two fee invoices: one for company 00001 for CAD and one for company 00003 for CAD.</div>

<a name="aref_section34"></a><h3 class="km">Real Time Aging in Accounts Receivable</h3>
<p><span id="pt1:r1:ot71" style="color: black;">Real Time Aging is a feature that allows an online view of open Customer Ledger records, aged as of a specific date. This feature can be found on the Row exit behind Account Balance Inquiry, or the Form exit behind Account Status Summary. The aging buckets for Real Time Aging are the same as the aging buckets used by Credit Analysis Refresh (R03B525).<br /><br />When Real Time Aging is accessed, the form prompts for an "Age As Of Date." The As Of Date will default from the R03B525 "Date: Age As Of" processing option on the Aging tab. If this processing option is not populated, Credit Analysis Refresh uses the system date.<br /><br />When the desired As Of aging date is entered, choose the Form exit to "Recalculate." Recalculating populates the Open Amount, Amount Past Due, Unapplied Amount, and aging buckets with the appropriate amounts, based on the customer number, company number, the As Of date entered, and the G/L date on the transaction record in the Customer Ledger ( F03B11).<br /><br />The amounts in the Open section of Account Status Summary form come from the F03B15 table. Again, running Credit Analysis Refresh (R03B525) generates this table.<br /><br />Since Real Time Aging uses the F03B11 table and Account Status Summary uses the Credit and Cash Management (F03B15) table, the results of these two aging methods typically have different results. Some reasons for the differences between the amounts in Account Status Summary vs. Real Time Aging are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span id="pt1:r1:ot71" style="color: black;">Real Time Aging only considers Customer Ledger items that are open at the as of the date entered in the         F03B11. No future amounts are considered; the amounts generated in the F03B15 consider future amounts where the G/L date is greater than the As Of aging date.</span></li>
<li><span id="pt1:r1:ot71" style="color: black;">Real Time Aging ages only by G/L date. Account Status Summary may age by either Due Date, Invoice Date, G/L Date, or Statement Date. The date to age by is determined by R03B525 Date Type processing option on the Aging tab.</span></li>
<li><span id="pt1:r1:ot71" style="color: black;">Real Time Aging always ages both unapplied receipts and credit memos by aging days and assigns them in the appropriate bucket. Account Status Summary amounts may or may not include unapplied receipts and credit memos and they may be aged differently. These options are controlled by the R03B525 Unapplied Receipts Aging and the Credit Amount Aging processing options on the Aging tab.</span></li>
</ol>
