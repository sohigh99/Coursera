<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<p>This document contains some frequently asked questions and answers on the Annual Close Report (R098201).</p>
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: For additional information on the Annual Close Report (R098201), you may refer to <a href='../docs/664688.html'>Overview of Annual Close Report (R098201)</a>.</div>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>General Questions</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> A Company has already closed its fiscal year. Can a particular year be closed again?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> You can close the same fiscal year as often as needed as multiple closings are often necessary to handle audit adjustments or unexpected final adjustments. For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close the year immediately to move the financial reporting period forward, and then close the year again after you enter audit adjustments.</li>
<li>Close the fiscal year at any time during the year to update inception-to-date amounts for reporting purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you close the fiscal year multiple times, the Annual Close program calculates and posts the correct balances without doubling or otherwise inflating balances. For example, if you run the program twice, balances are not doubled. If you run the program three times, balances are not tripled.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> How is the F0902 affected if R098201 report is submitted multiple times?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> The Annual Close can be rerun as often as necessary for the same fiscal year and company combination. Only Account Balance records for the next fiscal year will be updated. If the records do not exist, they are created. If changes are made to the prior year, the accounts affected will have their balance-forward amounts refreshed into the new year and the retained earnings will be updated (if the accounts affected fall within the profit and loss account range).</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong>&nbsp;Can the Annual Close be run in proof mode?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 3:</strong>&nbsp;The Annual Close does not have a proof or final mode. &nbsp;The Income Statement report (R10211B) gives you the retained earnings when run for period 12 for the fiscal year you want to close.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Can the Annual Close be run if the company is not in balance?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 4:</strong> The Annual Close will not check whether the company is in balance. It will just calculate retained earnings and bring the closing balance of the Balance Sheet accounts to the balance forward of next financial year.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong> Is the Annual Close dependent on the company&rsquo;s current period and fiscal year in the Company Names and Numbers (P0010)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> The current period and fiscal year have no bearing on running the Annual Close.&nbsp;However, it is recommended to run the Annual Close program after closing the fiscal year in Company Names and Numbers.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6:</strong> What are the ramifications of ending the Annual Close prior to a successful completion?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 6:</strong> Although it is not recommended to end the annual close job prior to completion, it will not cause major damage to your existing data. The company you ran it for may be out of balance if the retained earnings calculation was only partially completed and all of the beginning balances and prior year net postings were not moved forward correctly. But re-running the annual close report again would recalculate all of the partial calculations and correct any issues that may have been caused during the first time.</p>
<p class="km">In case the records in the Account Balance table (F0902) become damaged or if balances appear to be incorrect, run the Repost Account Ledger program (R099102) to update the period balances and then run the Annual Close report (R098201). For more information on R099102, refer to <a href='../docs/1387474.html'>Overview Repost Account Ledger Integrity Report (R099102)</a>.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7:</strong> Is it possible to run Annual Close for past years only for certain accounts without affecting the Retained Earnings?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 7:</strong> It is possible to run Annual Close only for certain accounts (data selection on Ledger Type, Fiscal Year and Account ID). The annual close will process only the records being selected. If the user wants to reclass an entry (debit/credit) between balance sheet accounts, Annual Close will not create any adjustments made to the Retained Earnings account. If the entry is between Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss accounts, then there will be an adjustment to Retained Earnings account. For example, if a user runs R098201 for a cash account, the report will not show any change to retained earnings. However, the cash account will be changed when reviewing the opening balance.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong> What is the difference in logic while processing balance sheet accounts and income statement accounts during annual close run?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8:</strong> The Annual Close updates the Balance Forward (APYC) and Prior Year End Net Posting (APYN) fields in the F0902 table for the new fiscal year for all accounts irrespective of whether the accounts are Balance Sheet or Income Statement accounts. However, the system does not show the balance forward amounts for profit-and-loss accounts in online inquiries or on reports that use AAI items GLG6 and GLG12. The system updates the Balance Forward field in the F0902 table to allow inception-to-date reporting, which is commonly used for job costing. When calculating retained earnings, the annual close will only consider amounts corresponding to Income Statement accounts defined by GLG06 and GLG12.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:</strong> What is the standard process to perform annual close for Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable before closing General Ledger?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 9:</strong> There is not any mandatory annual close process for AP and AR modules in EnterpriseOne system. However, there are certain procedures to follow before running the annual close as outlined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run all integrity reports for AP/AR and GL and make sure no integrity problem exists.</li>
<li>In AP, run the Update YTD Voucher Amount report (R04820A) to update YTD amount to the prior year column.</li>
<li>In AR, run the PYT &amp; YTD Amount report (R03B161) to update AR amount to the prior year column.</li>
<li>After making sure that there is no integrity issue and Trial Balance is balanced, run the Annual Close (R098201).</li>
<li>Upon completion, you may change the fiscal year and current period in your Company Names &amp; Number.</li>
</ol><hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong> How do I prevent calculation of retained earnings for a specific ledger type when running Annual Close?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10:</strong>&nbsp; The Close to Retained Earnings Account option in the Ledger Types Rules (P0025) application specifies whether the Annual Close program (R098201) closes accounts in any ledger type to a retained earnings account or not. This flag must be selected for the AA and AZ ledgers. For other ledger types, disable the "Close to Retained Earnings Account " flag in order to prevent calculation of retained earnings.</p>
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong>&nbsp;Why is there a difference in Retained Earning amounts when re-running the annual close?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11:</strong>&nbsp;The difference can be due to following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes made to GLG6 - GLG12 AAI items (Revenue Statement accounts range).</li>
<li>Prior year adjustment entries created for Revenue Statement accounts.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12:</strong>&nbsp;Is it necessary to run Annual Close after office hours when users are not log into the system?</h4>
<p><strong style="font-size: 10px;">Answer 12:</strong>&nbsp;It is not necessary to run annual close after office hours. Users can still log into the system as long as they are not performing any posting to the fiscal year you are trying to close.</span></p>
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13: </strong>Can R098201 close program clear budget figures for balance sheet accounts? It does clear the income accounts.</span></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 13: </strong>No, the R098201 will not clear budget balance sheet accounts. You would need to clear the APYC for the balance sheet accounts via some type of data base utility.</span></p>
</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Data Selection and Processing Options</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> What data selection is recommended while running the annual close ?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 1:</strong> It is mandatory that the Data Selection includes Century with a particular Fiscal Year. Further, data selection by Company and Ledger Type are optional.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> How do you determine the fiscal year for data selection, if you are not running on a calendar year?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> The fiscal year is defined as the last day of the first period. For instance, if your fiscal date pattern is June 2011 to May 2012, last day of the first period in this case is 30th June 2011 and hence the fiscal year will be 11.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section218"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> How does the processing options (Zero Balance Accounts/ Profit &amp; Loss) for Annual Close report relate to the Job Cost module?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 3:</strong> Annual Close (R098201) Processing options related to Job Cost are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="km"><strong>Profit/Loss processing option</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Job Cost accounts (jobs) can be set up as balance sheet or profit and loss accounts, depending on the nature of the business. If profit and loss accounts are used and there is a zero net posting for the year being closed, by default this will not create a record for the next year. In most cases jobs will probably not be completed within the year. In this case, it may be necessary to roll the account balances forward to the next year. To do this, enter a '1' in the option to roll P&amp;L Accounts with a zero balance in net posting for the year being closed. Default of blank will not create P&amp;L Accounts for the next year if net posting for the year being closed in zero.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>It is not recommended to view Job Cost in any G/L program because the balance forwards for P&amp;L accounts are not displayed in System 09. Please view these accounts in the Job Cost System.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="km"><strong>Original Budget processing option</strong></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>This option allows the original budget to be overridden regardless of whether next years record already exists. If an original budget already exists for the year being closed to, this option allows for that amount to be overridden by the original from the year being closed. For example, if an original budget has been entered for fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012, this option will allow the 2012 original budget to be overridden with the fiscal year 2011 original budget. If overriding the original budget with new information, enter a '1' for this processing option.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section219"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>52 Period Accounting</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section220"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong>&nbsp;Are there any specific recommendations for performing &nbsp;the Annual Close for 52 Period Accounting?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 1:</strong>&nbsp;After you run the Annual Close program (R098201) at the end of a fiscal year, run the Annual Close for 52 Period program (R09820B). The Annual Close for 52 Period program updates the Account Balance - 52 Period Accounting table (F0902B) table with balances from the F0902 table.</p>
<a name="aref_section221"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Common Issues</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section222"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> After inactivating accounts and business units (no longer required), will retained earnings still roll up correctly after running the annual close?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> The inactive accounts are treated just like active accounts by the Annual Close program. The Balance Forward (APYC), Prior Year End Net Posting (APYN) fields in F0902 and Retained Earnings are updated correctly in either case.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section223"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Why do income statement transactions in another ledger type, such as GP, not post to the retained earnings account?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Please ensure to check the "Close to Retained Earnings Account" for Ledger Type GP in Ledger Types Rules Setup (P0025) and the retained earnings will get calculated correctly for GP ledger.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section224"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3:</strong> During auditing, client has found certain entries that had been posted to the GLG4 Retained Earnings account. How to avoid this in future and how can these be corrected?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 3:</strong> The GLG4 Retained Earnings account should never have any corresponding F0911 transactions. In future, if adjusting entries or beginning balances for Retained Earnings is desired, set the system up in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account 1: Retained Earnings (AAI - GLG4) ex. 1.4980</li>
<ul>
<li>Level Of Detail = X</li>
<li>Post Edit Code = M (no F0911 transactions and F0902 only populated by Annual Close program)</li>
</ul>
<li>Account 2: Sub Account only for transactions ex. 1.4980.SUB</li>
<ul>
<li>LOD = X+1</li>
<li>PEC = (blank)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="km">If existing transactions are in the Retained Earnings Account, correct in the following way:</p>
<p class="km"><strong>Non-Currency environment:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer the existing F0911 records from Account 1 by creating a new Journal Entry (using the same gl date as original). Transfer these transactions to Account 2; transaction by transaction. Make sure that the Post Edit Code on Account 1 is blank to allow all posting.</li>
<li>Re-run Annual Close (year by year) for the Company(ies). This rebuilds the correct F0902 records for the (GLG4) Retained Earnings account.</li>
<li>Change Post Edit Code on Account 1 to M.</li>
</ol>
<p class="km">Now all records will be fine. From this point on, Account 1 will have true Retained Earnings figures. Account 2 will be an adjustment account used in Financial Reporting as a rollup to the Retained Earnings account.</p>
<p class="km"><strong>Multi-Currency environment:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer the transactions as stated above in Step 1.</li>
<li>Run the Restatement Program (R11414A) for a particular starting year.</li>
<li>Run the Annual Close for both the AA and restated ledger for a particular starting year</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each year up to the current fiscal year.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps for all companies.</li>
</ol><hr />
<a name="aref_section225"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4:</strong> Why does the ending balance from previous year not match the beginning balance for current year after running the Annual Close?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> When running the Annual Close for the year, the annual close calculates the retained earnings and plugs the calculated value in the beginning balance (APYC) for the next year, that is why the values are different from the last day of the year to the first day of the following year. The amounts would match only if the retained earnings would be zero, otherwise the difference between beginning and ending balance is equal to amount calculated to retained earnings after running the annual close.</p>
<a name="aref_section226"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5:</strong>&nbsp;The Annual Close was run by mistake for a future fiscal year. &nbsp;Is it possible to undo the updates the report created in the F0902?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 5:</strong>&nbsp;Please note that the Annual close can be run as many times as required for any fiscal year. Hence running the Annual Close for an incorrect future year should not cause any issues as the balances will be recalculated, when you run the Annual Close next time. Anyhow, if you may like to reset the effect, you may consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no period amounts exist, run the Purge Prior Year Actual Balance program (R09912) for the company, fiscal year and ledger type. This clears the amounts created by the Annual Close.</li>
<li>If period amounts do exists, a database utility needs to be used to remove the values for the beginning balance forward (APYC) field.</li>
</ul>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note: When database corrections are necessary:
<ul>
<li>Copy the production data into a test environment, and make the required correction in the test environment first.</li>
<li>If the results are satisfactory, promote the corrected data to the production environment.</li>
</ul>

<a name="aref_section229"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> How can I improve the performance of the Annual Close?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> To get the annual close to run faster, its recommended to data select on the AA ledger, Fiscal Year and Company (or group of companies on the same fiscal date pattern). The processing option to show detail on the report will also impact performance.</p>

<a name="aref_section231"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> What security should be applied after closing a financial year to prevent users from accessing the closed year data?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> After closing a financial year and moving on to the current period/year in Company Names and Numbers (P0010), the users can no longer post to the prior year, with the exception of ## journal entry types which were specifically created for posting to prior years. Furthermore, the standard method for controlling post to prior periods is through the PBCO option in General Accounting constants (P0000). Apart from this, there are no standard methods to secure users from accessing prior year data.</p>

<a name="aref_section232"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Print Output</strong></h3>
<a name="aref_section233"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is it possible to get a summary of each account on the Annual Close report rather than multiple pages of detail or just one line item?</h4>
<p class="km"><strong>Answer 1:</strong> When the Print processing option under the Print Tab for the Annual Close is set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;, to print the supporting detail on the Annual Close report, each F0902 balance for each account will print on the report. This can result in a very large and detailed report. This is especially true when subledgers are being used as you will see all the subledger and subledger type information on the report. The only exception to this is if the posting edit code is set to &ldquo;S&rdquo; to post subledger information in summary format. When this processing option is blank, then the report prints only one line showing the retained earning calculation.</p>
