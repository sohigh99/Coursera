<H2 class=km><A NAME="PURPOSE"></A>Purpose</H2>
<a name="aref_section11"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Overview of Payment Terms and Advanced Payment Terms</strong></h3>
<p class="km">Payment terms are used by the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable systems to specify a payment due date and, optionally, a discount percent and discount due date. The system uses Payment Terms to calculate the due dates and discounts on vouchers and invoices for efficient transaction entry.</p>
<p class="km">Each customer and supplier may have a default Payment Term defined that are used automatically when creating a voucher or invoice. The default value can be accepted or overridden with a different Payment Term.</p>
<p class="km">Payment Term Codes can range from simple to complex, depending on your organization's policies.Payment Terms can be defined by using a one-, two-, or three-character combination of these types of characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alphabetic (A-ZZZ)</li>
<li>Numeric (0-999)</li>
<li>Special characters (including blank)</li>
</ul>
<p class="km">For example, you might use A1%, which combines all three types of characters, for a percentage Payment Term Code. The JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable modules use the same payment terms.</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="SCOPE"></A>Scope</H2>
<p>This document is intended for users who are setting up and revising Payment Terms to be used in the Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable modules.</p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="BODYTEXT"></A>Details</H2>
<a name="aref_section31"></a><h4 class="km">Commonly Used Payment Terms</h4>
<p class="km">It is recommended that a blank Payment Term Code be configured for the most commonly used Payment Term. However, there should also be an identical Payment Term that has a code other than blank to be used as an override during voucher and invoice entry. If a non-blank Payment Term is the default on the customer or supplier record, changing the Payment Term to blank during entry does not replace the default Payment Term. For example, if the supplier master record is set up to use 001 as the payment term code, and you want to override it on the voucher to the blank payment term code, the system will continue to supply the default (001) from the supplier record every time the field is cleared.</p>

<p>To begin setting up Standard Payment Terms, select Payment Term Revisions from the Payment Term Revisions (G00141) menu. From Work with Payment Terms (P0014) form, you can create a new payment term or revise an existing payment term.&nbsp; <br /><br />When entering a new Payment Term, you must enter a unique code that specifies the terms of payment in the Payment Term Code (data dictionary item PTC field). Examples of payment terms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>001: 1/10 net 30. (1% discount if paid within 10 days or next due date is 30 days)</li>
<li>002: 2/10 net 30. (2% discount if paid within 10 days or next due data is 30 days)</li>
<li>003: Due on the 10th day of every month. (Proximate date and month example)</li>
</ul>

<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">If the Payment Term is to be used in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable module, enter the date that the net payment is due. Conversely, if the Payment Term is to be used in the Accounts Payable module, enter the date that the payment is due to receive a discount. If no discount is offered, enter the net due date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Net Days To Pay (NDTP)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the number of days that the system adds to the invoice date to calculate the due date on the invoice or voucher. If you use split payment terms, the system uses the value from this field to calculate the due date for the first split payment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Discount % (DCP)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the percent of the total invoice or voucher that you will allow a discount if it is paid within the discount period. Enter the discount percent as a decimal, for example, a 2 percent discount is .02.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Discount Days (DCD)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the number of days after the invoice date that an invoice or voucher must be paid to receive the discount. The system adds the number of days specified to the invoice due date to calculate the discount due date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Prox Date Month (PXDM)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the number of months that the system adds to the invoice date to calculate the due date. The system uses this field in conjunction with the value specified in the Proximate Day field (PXDD) to calculate the due date. <br />
<ul>
<li>For example, if the proximate month is 1 and proximate day is 15, the system calculates the due date as the 15th of the next month.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Day (PXDD)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the day that the invoice or voucher is due. The system uses this field in conjunction with the value in the Proximate Month field (PXDX) to calculate the due date. For example, if the proximate month is 1 and proximate day is 15, the system calculates the due date as the 15th of the next month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Number of Split Payments (NSP)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the number of equal, consecutive payments into which you want the system to divide the invoice or voucher. For example, if the number of split payments is 3, the system divides the invoice or voucher into three equal payments. You can use split payments only if the number of days between payments is a constant number, such as 30.&nbsp;&nbsp; For amounts that are not equally divisible, the system uses soft rounding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Days To Pay Aging (DTPA)</td>
<td class="km" style="width: 50%;">Enter the number of days that the system uses to calculate the due date for each subsequent payment if you use split payments. For example, if the number of split payments is 4 and the days to pay aging is 30, the system adds thirty to the due date calculated for the first payment to obtain the due date for the second payment. The system adds 30 to the second payment to obtain the due date for the third payment, and so on.<br /><br />The system uses the value from the Net Days to Pay field to calculate the due date for the first payment.</td>

<div class="kmnotebox">Note: The information defined on a Payment Term is used to calculate Due Dates on Invoices and Vouchers as they are entered. However, negative invoices or vouchers (debit or credit) might use the GL Date (data dictionary item DGJ) as the Due Date regardless of the payment term entered. A processing option in the master business function (P0400047 for vouchers and P03B0011 for invoices) controls how the system calculates the Due Date for debit and credit memos.</div>
<a name="aref_section35"></a><h4 class="km">Standard Payment Term Examples</h4>
<a name="aref_section36"></a><h5 class="km">Due Upon Receipt</h5>
<p>A Due Upon Receipt Payment term is when the payment is due upon the receipt of goods and services. In terms of EnterpriseOne Standard Payment Terms, a Due Upon Receipt payment term creates a Due Date the same day as the Invoice Date. This payment term is set up with blank fields so no calculation is made.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pt05.png" border="0" alt="Due Upon Receipt" title="Due Upon Receipt" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p>
<p>Example results:</p>

<a name="aref_section37"></a><h5 class="km">Net Due Date&nbsp;</h5>
<p>A Net Due Date payment term is where the payment is due a set number of days after the invoice date. For example, if you want a due date that is 30 days after the invoice date, a Standard Payment Term would be set up with a Days to Add value of 30.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pt07.png" border="0" alt="Net Due Date" title="Net Due Date" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p>

<a name="aref_section08"></a><h5 class="km">Proximate Date</h5>
<p>A Proximate Due Date rule calculates a payment due date a set number of months after the invoice datea nd on a specific date in that month. For example, if a payment needs to be due on the 10th day of a month, 2 months after the invoice date, the Payment Term can be set up as follows:</p>
<p><img src="../images/pt09.png" border="0" alt="Proximate Date" title="Proximate Date" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p>

<a name="aref_section39"></a><h5 class="km">Fixed Days</h5>
<p>A Fixed Days payment term is where a due date is a specific day regardless of the invoice date.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pt11.png" border="0" alt="Fixed Days" title="Fixed Days" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p>
<p>Example results:</p>

<a name="aref_section310"></a><h5 class="km">Split Payment Term</h5>
<p>A Split Payment Term calculates multiple pay items on an invoice or voucher with separate due dates. Standard Payment Terms provides the ability to split into multiple pay items of the same amount.&nbsp;</p>

<a name="aref_section312"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Payment Terms Report (R0014)</strong></h3>
<p>To get a printed list of Standard Payment Terms that are currently defined, run the Payment Terms Report (R0014). This report is helpful for users who may be entering vouchers or invoices or updating default payment terms in customer or suppliers.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pt17.png" border="0" alt="R0014" title="R0014" hspace="0" vspace="0" /></p>
<a name="aref_section313"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Understanding Advanced Payment Terms (P0014, P00145, P00146)</strong></h3>
<p>Advanced Payment Terms provide further customization options for Payment Due Dates with the addition of Due Date Rules. Due Date Rules provide the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to use a workday calendar and workday rule to indicate which days of the month are workdays and which are weekends and holidays. Additionally, if due dates fall on a weekend or holiday, you can specify whether to use that date or have the system automatically change the due date to the previous or following working day.</li>
<li>Ability to specify the based-on date. Unlike the due dates for standard payment terms, which are always based on the invoice date, advanced payment terms allow you to specify whether to use the invoice date, GL date, or service/tax date.</li>
<li>Ability to specify the number of days and months to add to or subtract from the based-on date using a range of transaction dates, or specify the months to add and a fixed date using a date range.</li>
<li>Ability to specify unique rules for net and discount due dates. You could have net due dates that use a date range and are based on the GL Date, and discount due dates that have a fixed date based on the Invoice Date.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system stores advanced payment term information in the following tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Payment Terms (F00141)</li>
<li>Due Date Rules (F00142)</li>
<li>Due Date Rules Day Range (F00143)</li>
<li>Installment Payment Terms (F00144)</li>
<li>Multitiered Payment Terms (F00147)</li>
</ul>
<p>The programs used to set up Advanced Payment terms can be accessed from the Payment Terms Revisions (G00141) menu.</p>

<a name="aref_section314"></a><h4 class="km">Adding a Work Day Calendar</h4>
<p>The first step in adding a Work Day Calendar, is defining the Calendar Type in UDC table 42/WD (Work Day Calendar Type). The Description (data dictionary item DL01) field should be used to specify the calendar's use. For example, it might be specific to an industry such as banking.&nbsp; After the desired calendar types are defined, the Work with Workday Calendar program (P00071) can be used to add a new calendar.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note: If you use the default value of * for Calendar Type (data dictionary item WDCT) in the Work with Workday Calendar program (P00071), the system updates the value to blank even if this code does not exist in UDC table 42/WD (Work Day Calendar Type).</div>

<p>To calculate new discount percentages and discount due dates on invoices or vouchers that are assigned a multitiered discount payment term, the Update A/R Invoices program (R005142) or the Update A/P Vouchers program (R005141) can be run. The reports work similar in both Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable. They use the date defined in Processing Option 1: As Of Date to determine what transactions are eligible for update and what tier should be used. For&nbsp; example, a payment term is set up with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based-on date = invoice date</li>
<li>Days to add = 10</li>
<li>First tier 1&ndash;10 with a 10 percent discount.</li>
<li>Second tier = 11&ndash;20 with a 5 percent discount.</li>
<li>Third tier = 21&ndash;29 with a 1 percent discount.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an invoice exists with an Invoice Date of June 1 and the Processing Option 1: As Of Date is set to June 12, the system recalculates the discount amount as 5% per the second tier.</p>

<p>This example illustrates how the Work Day Calendar can be used to create an annual due date rule. Annual due date rules are when the due date is always on the same day every year, this is usually used for things like magazine subscriptions. For this, the work day calendar is set up to have that specific date each year as the only working day for the year. This example shows it as May 14. The down side to this set up is that a work day calendar must be set up for every month of every year.</p>

<p>Advanced Payment Terms can also be used to create installments, which can break up a transaction into multiple pay items. Each pay item can be set up with different due date rules, so they can have very individual due dates. In this example, any voucher or invoice created using this payment term is split into three pay items. All three pay items are using the same due date rule. Two of them are for 25% of the original total and the last one is for 50%. Each pay item also can have a different discount percentage.</p>

<a name="aref_section332"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Understanding Due Date versus Net Due Date Fields</strong></h3>
<p>When a voucher is entered, the system automatically calculates the Net Due Date and the Discount Due Date based on the Payment Terms. The Payment Terms default from the Supplier Master (P04012) or Customer Master (P03013) but can be manually overridden at the time of voucher entry. Furthermore, the Voucher and Invoice entry programs allow for the system calculated Due Date to be changed manually. The Due Date is the date that the pay item is due and payable (for example, 30 days from the invoice date). The Discount Due Date is the final date that the pay item must be paid to receive a discount from the supplier.</p>
<div class="kmnotebox">Note: The value of the Discount Due Date is stored and displayed in a field for the Net Due Date (DDJ), while the value of the Net Due Date is stored in the field for the Discount Due Date (DDNJ). <a href='/epmos/faces/BugDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=1411304.1&id=10719044' target='_blank' >Bug 10719044</a> has been entered for this issue and may be addressed in a future release. At this time, the modifications cannot be made due to the vast impact the modification has on several applications and UBEs. The current EnterpriseOne solution has been designed to take this issue into account. As a result, the system will correctly handle Net Due Date and Discount Due Date processing.</div>
<a name="aref_section333"></a><h3 class="km"><strong>Payment Terms in Accounts Payable</strong></h3>
<p>After defining payment terms, in either Advanced or Standard functionality, they can then be used in Accounts Payable by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up a Default Value in the Supplier Master (P04012).</li>
<li>Overwriting the Default directly in the Voucher Entry itself, either in the header or the grid for each pay item (P0411).</li>

<p><strong>Processing Option 1: Pay Through Date</strong> - Include vouchers with a Due Date on or before the Pay Through Date. If the value in Pay Through Date is greater than or equal to Due Date, then the voucher is included in the payment group.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Option 2: Displacement Days</strong> - The number of days to add to today's date to include vouchers with a Due Date on or before that date.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Option 3: Discount Cutoff Date</strong> - The final date that a discount is allowed to be taken. Vouchers with a Discount Due Date after this date are eligible.
