<p>This document contains answer to frequently asked questions related to the Business Units. </p>
<H2 class=km><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Questions and Answers</H2>
<a name="aref_section21"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 1:</strong> How do I import external data for Business Unit Master (F0006)?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> Currently there is no existing application or flat file upload process to import external data for Business Units. However, you may consider the following workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inquire on existing business units in Work with Business Units application (P0006) and select at least one business unit in the detail grid.</li>
<li>Select "Rev Mul BU" Row exit. This will take you to Revise Multiple Business Units form with a detail grid having import/export functionality.</li>
<li>You should compare the columns in your spreadsheet to those on the Revise Multiple Business Units form. Customize the grid and rearrange the columns on the Revise Multiple Business Units form so that they match your spreadsheet and the order in which the columns appear on the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>One recommended method to create an Excel Spreadsheet with the columns in the same order as the columns in the grid is by selecting the option from Tools to Export Grid Data. This will create a spreadsheet with the columns in the correct format for the Business Units import based on the columns in the grid of the application.  Once the spreadsheet is created, you can then fill it in with the appropriate details and use it for the import.</li>
<li>Ensure that you are not using the duplicate business units in order to avoid duplicate business units.</li>
<li>Its advisable to first execute the complete cycle of business units import process for a single record. If the record is processed with success, you can consider the successfully processed record as a baseline to import the rest of data.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section22"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 2: </strong>Is there any enhancement available for Adjustment entries in the Business Unit Master application (P0006) in higher releases?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 2: </strong>In 9.0 and all subsequent releases, a new "Adjustment Entry" field has been added under the More Detail tab in Business Unit Master application (P0006). Following are the characteristics for this newly added attribute:<strong><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select this check box to restrict the business unit and all associated accounts to adjustment entries only.</li>
<li>This check box allows you to post adjusting entries for journal allocations, reburdening, and so on to business units that might otherwise be closed for regular transactions.</li>
<li>You define the document types that qualify as adjustment entries in UDC table 09/AA.</li>
<li>If you use the data relationships functionality, be aware that data relationships destination columns that are check boxes function differently than destination columns that are fields.</li>
</ul>
<div class="kmnotebox">For more information on "Adjustment Entry" attribute, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664707.1&id=1465051.1'>Document 1465051.1</a> How to use the Adjustment Entry Field to Only Allow Certain Entries to Post to the System.</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section23"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 3: </strong>How do I change company for an existing Business Unit?<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 3: </strong>Changing company for an business unit or moving a business unit to a different company will require the following related tables to be realigned with the new company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Master (F0901)</li>
<li>Account Ledger (F0911)</li>
<li>Account Balances (F0902)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to the <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664707.1&id=664718.1'>Document 664718.1</a> How to Change the Company Number for a Business Unit for complete details on this process.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section24"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 4: </strong>Can I review the idle business units which never had any kind of transactions in the EnterpriseOne system?<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 4: </strong>Currently there is no existing application or report to list all business units that were never used for a transaction. If you know a specific business unit you could search through your Account Ledger (F0911) table for any entries or run following reports with data selection using that specific Business Unit to review if it has any related transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account Ledger Print (R09200P)</li>
<li>G/L by Business Unit Report (R09420)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section25"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 5: </strong>Can I purge or delete a business unit that was never used?<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong><strong>Answer 5: </strong></strong>Delete Business Unit/Company report (R09925) will delete records for a single business unit or for all of the business units within a single company. The Delete Business Unit/Company program deletes records from following tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Unit Master (F0006)</li>
<li>Business Unit Alternate Description Master (F0006D)</li>
<li>Account Master (F0901)</li>
<li>Account Master - Alternate Description (F0901D)</li>
<li>Account Balances (F0902)</li>
<li>Account Ledger (F0911)</li>
</ul>
<div class="kmnotebox">NOTE: R09925 report should be used with utmost caution since it deletes records for the business unit or company regardless of whether open balances exist. Be sure that this business unit was never used. A backup of the affected tables is recommended. Please refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664707.1&id=1404833.1'>Document 1404833.1</a> Overview of Delete Business Unit/Company Program (R09925).</div>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section26"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 6: </strong>Is there any Global Update available to update the latest Category Codes information for Business Units?<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong><strong>Answer 6:</strong></strong> You can run the Business Unit Global Category Codes Update F0101&gt;F0006 (R098021) report to update the business units category codes with the latest information available in Address Book Master (F0101). For more information on R098021 report, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664707.1&id=1393213.1'>Document 1393213.1</a>.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section27"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 7: </strong>Is there a standard process available for updating the Business Unit segment globally?<strong><br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong><strong>Answer 7: </strong></strong>You can change the business unit portion of the account number by globally changing the business units. For example, you can change business unit 91009 to business unit 910092 for all object and object.subsidiary accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the P09812 application to change business unit for multiple accounts. The Global Business Unit Change interactive program (P09812) internally submits Global Business Unit Change report (R09812) which updates the F0901 table for each account.</li>
<li>After you change the related accounts for the business unit, you must update the F0911 and F0902 tables with the revised information by running the Update BU.Obj.Sub to Journal Entry program (R09806).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on P09812 and R09806 processes, refer to <a href='/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=DOCUMENT&sourceId=664707.1&id=1390947.1'>Document 1390947.1</a>.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section28"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 8:</strong> After upgrading to 9.0 or any subsequent release, why do I get "Not found in User Defined Code" while adding or updating a business unit?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 8:</strong> In 9.0 and subsequent releases, additional business unit category codes 31 - 50 have been added as an enhancement. Further, the UDC table 00|42 does not contain the blank value which is causing the system to throw an error. The issue would be resolved by adding a blank value with '.' description to UDC 00|42.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section29"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 9:</strong> Are numeric fields MCAN8GCA1  - MCAN8GCA5 within the F0006 Business Unit table available for end users to populate, like category codes?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 9: </strong>The F0006 MCAN8GCA1 - MCAN8GCA5 fields were added as a requirement for Project and Government Contract Accounting.  These fields allow the user to attach additional addresses to a job.  However, because of their generic nature, they have been available for standard business units as well.  They are intended to be used for reference purposes.</p>
<p>If you are not using them with business units for Project and Government Contract Accounting you could populate them for your needs.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section210"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 10:</strong> When inquiring for business units in applications P0006 and P0006S with QBE filters for Business Unit column, the application does not display all records. For instance, when inquired with QBE filter &lsquo;1*&rsquo; the application does not list the business unit 1, but when the inquired after aligning the filter with some blank spaces, the application lists the business unit 1 record</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 10: </strong>This is because the Business Unit (MCU) is a alpha numeric field and is of length 12. Business unit &lsquo;1&rsquo; will be saved to the table F0006 with eleven leading blank spaces as &ldquo;           1&rdquo; in table. So when inquired with a QBE filter &lsquo;1*&rsquo;, the application will list the business units which start with 1 without any blank spaces in beginning. The QBE filter should be given as &lsquo;*<strong>1</strong>*&rsquo; to list all the values that have 1 in the business unit value</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section211"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 11:</strong> Is there a program in JDE  to  purge or delete a Company ?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 11: </strong>R09925 is a program which is used to  delete/Purge records for a company. Business Unit will take precedence over Company.This procedure will delete records from the Business Unit Master, Account Master, Account Balances, Account Ledger, and Alternate Description files. A backup should be run prior to running this program</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section212"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 12:</strong> How to make a Category Code required ?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 12: </strong>Each Category Code is linked to a UDC. Category Code 0xx is linked to UDC 00|xx (e.g. Category Code 027 is linked to UDC 00|27). If a blank value is not available in the corresponding UDC, that Category Code will require a value to be entered.<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<a name="aref_section213"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 13:</strong> Are spaces allowed when creating business units?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 13: </strong> Spaces (or other special characters) are not allowed when creating business units.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section214"></a><h4 class="km"><strong>Question 14:</strong> What is the proper way to prevent all accounts in a company from being posted to in the future?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer 14: </strong>It would be recommended to mark the business units for the concerned company as non-posting or inactive via Work with Business Units (P0006). This will automatically make all the associated accounts as inactive for that particular company.</p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section215"></a><h4 class="km"> <strong>Question 15:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">When attempting to update the Business Unit in Review and Revise Business Unit (P0006) an error is received on Category Code 17.  There is an * for All Values, is it OK to use this value in order to update the record?   What may have changed that is causing this? </span></h4>
<p><strong>Answer 15:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">The P0006 is used in a number of different applications and may be under a slightly different application number, such as Real Estate which is P15062.  The application still updates the P0006. <br />there may be another application that is using a form of this that now needs a value in the Cat Code 17 field.   Review the UDC values to see is if you can identify the group that may be associated with the cat code. <br /><br />It is OK to use the * as there is not a blank value available in order to update the record.  It is also recommended to review the cat code and validate whether this needs to be updated due to additional set up required by some other application after the record has been updated. </span></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section216"></a><h4 class="km"><span><strong>Question 16:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">Why does the Business Unit (P0006S) not display results for Portuguese language when searching on description field? </span><br /></span></h4>
<p><span><strong>Answer 16:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">This must be set up in the  Business Unit Alternate Description Master (F0006D) for Language (LNGP): P.<br />This can be accessed from Business Unit (P0006) take the Row exit to Translation and select the Transl Single BU </span></span></p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section217"></a><h4 class="km"><span><strong>Question 17:</strong> Is it possible to disable the AP and AR functions (i.e. invoicing, payment receipt, vouchering) for a particular business unit while leaving the GL functionality for the business unit enabled?<br /></span></h4>
<p><span><strong>Answer 17:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1"> There isn't any functionality that would allow for you to turn on activity for a business unit for GA purposes while simultaneously turning off activity for AP and AR purposes.  To clarify, there is no "checkbox" option that will do this in any of the constants screens or in the business unit setup on P0006 for example.  It may be possible, however, to make use of various security settings as a workaround to achieve an outcome similar to this goal.<br /></span></span></p>
<hr />
<a name="aref_section218"></a><h4 class="km"><span><strong>Question 18:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">How to populate table F0006S? </span><br /></span></h4>
<p><span><strong>Answer 18:</strong> <span id="form1:panelPage1">The Build Date-Effective Bus. Unit Master program (R0006S) can be used to create a snapshot or copy of the business unit category code structure that currently exists in the Business Unit Master table (F0006).<br />This batch program copies the current business unit category code structure into the Date Effective Business Unit Master table (F0006S). </span></span></p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<a name="aref_section219"></a><h4 class="km"><span><strong>Question 19: Is there a global update program to change business unit description in F0006?</strong></span></h4>
<p><span><strong>Answer 19: JDE does not have a global update program to change BU description from F0006</strong></span></p>
